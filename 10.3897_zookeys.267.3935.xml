                <label>Abstract</label>
                <p>Copepods have been poorly studied in subterranean habitats in Korea. Previous records have indicated mostly the presence of species already described from Japan, with very few endemic elements. This commonality has usually been explained by repeated dispersal across the land bridges that connected the two countries several times during the Pleistocene glacial cycles. However, the Korean Peninsula is known for pockets of Cambrian and Ordovician carbonate rocks, with more than 1,000 caves already having been explored. The relative isolation of these carbonate pockets makes for an enormous speciation potential, and the development of a high level of short-range endemism of subterranean copepods should be expected. Representatives of the genus <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops</tp:taxon-name></italic> Kiefer, 1927 are here investigated from a range of subterranean habitats in South Korea, with comparative material sampled from central Honshu in Japan. Morphological analyses of microcharacters, many of which are used in cyclopoid taxonomy for the first time herein, reveal high diversity in both countries. No subterranean species is found in common, although the existence of four sibling species pairs in Korea and Japan may be indicative of relatively recent speciation. We describe seven new stygobiotic species, including three from Korea (<italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops hanguk</tp:taxon-name></italic> <bold>sp. n.</bold>, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops leeae</tp:taxon-name></italic> <bold>sp. n.</bold>, and <!--PageBreak--><italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops parasuoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> <bold>sp. n.</bold>) and four from Japan (<italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops hisuta</tp:taxon-name></italic> <bold>sp. n.</bold>, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops ishidai</tp:taxon-name></italic> <bold>sp. n.</bold>, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops parahanguk</tp:taxon-name></italic> <bold>sp. n.</bold>, and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops pseudosuoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> <bold>sp. n.</bold>). <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops hanguk</tp:taxon-name></italic>, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops parasuoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic>, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops ishidai</tp:taxon-name></italic>, and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops parahanguk</tp:taxon-name></italic> are described from newly collected material, while the other three new species are proposed for specimens previously identified as other, widely distributed species. <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops brevifurcus</tp:taxon-name></italic> Ishida, 2006 is redescribed from the holotype female, and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops suoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> Ito, 1954 is redescribed from material newly collected near the ancient Lake Biwa in Japan. This research provides evidence for the importance of subterranean habitats as reservoirs of biodiversity, and also demonstrates the inadequacy of current morphological methods of identifying closely related species of copepods. The disproportionately high diversity discovered around Lake Biwa provides further evidence in support of the hypothesis about the role of ancient lakes as biodiversity pumps for subterranean habitats. A key to the East Asian species of the <italic>languidoides</italic>-group is provided.

            <p>Until recently, freshwater cyclopoids in Korea were studied predominantly in surface water habitats, with 50 species recorded so far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Chang 2009</xref>). Only one species, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Acanthocyclops orientalis</tp:taxon-name></italic> Borutzky, 1966, has been reported as a stygobiont, and about six others as stygophiles. In the course of a research project aimed at uncovering Korean invertebrate diversity, and led by the National Institute of Biological Resources (NIBR), subterranean waters were sampled throughout South Korea and identification of copepods was entrusted to the senior author (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Karanovic and Lee 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Karanovic et al. 2012b</xref>). Two different and independent research projects were conducted in Japan, with partial goals of exploring the groundwater fauna around Lake Biwa and clarifying the role of ancient lakes in the diversity of the subterranean fauna in their vicinity. The latter projects were led by the Lake Biwa Museum (LBM), and identification of copepods was also entrusted to the senior author (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Karanovic and Abe 2010</xref>).
            </p>
            <p>Here we present the results for <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops</tp:taxon-name></italic> Kiefer, 1927, which is the largest genus of the family <tp:taxon-name>Cyclopidae</tp:taxon-name> Rafinesque, 1815 (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Boxshall and Halsey 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Dussart and Defaye 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">Walter and Boxshall 2012</xref>). <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops</tp:taxon-name></italic> is an ideal group for zoogeographical studies, with different species in surface and subterranean habitats, and some that can exploit both. This genus has a long history of taxonomic problems though (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">Stoch 2001</xref>), and it is recognised to be polyphyletic or at least paraphyletic by many researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Monchenko and von Vaupel Klein 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Monchenko 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Karanovic 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2006</xref>). Although the genus name is valid, and its type species is surrounded by a large flock of closely related congeners, ever since its initial erection by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Kiefer (1927)</xref> as a subgenus of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Cyclops</tp:taxon-name></italic> Müller, 1785 it has had the misfortune of having assigned to it all cyclopoids with even superficially similar fifth legs. Even <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Kiefer (1927)</xref> recognised two distinct groups of species within <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops</tp:taxon-name></italic>: one containing <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops bicuspidatus</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Claus, 1857) [type species], <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops bisetosus</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Rehberg, 1880), <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops crassicaudis</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Sars, 1863), and some others; and the other group including species with a higher degree of appendage oligomerization, such as <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops languidus</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Sars, 1863), <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops languidoides</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Lilljeborg, 1901), <!--PageBreak-->and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops stygius</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Chappuis, 1924). That <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Kiefer (1928)</xref> was aware of the polyphyletic nature of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops</tp:taxon-name></italic> is obvious from his proposed phylogenetic tree (p. 547). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">Reid and Strayer (1994)</xref> noted that the diagnosis of this genus is so broad that it is effectively based solely on the structure of the fifth leg, a character considered probably plesiomorphic by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Karanovic (2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2006</xref>).
            </p>
            <p>Another part of the troubled taxonomic history of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops</tp:taxon-name></italic> is the similarity of its fifth leg to that typical for <italic><tp:taxon-name>Acanthocyclops</tp:taxon-name></italic> Kiefer, 1927; many species have been transferred back and forth between these two genera multiple times (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Morton 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Pandourski 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Monchenko and von Vaupel Klein 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Dussart and Defaye 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Karanovic et al. 2012a</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Ferrari (1991)</xref> was probably wrong when he suggested that <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Acanthocyclops</tp:taxon-name></italic> belong to two different monophyletic groups of cyclopoids, as he grouped <italic><tp:taxon-name>Acanthocyclops</tp:taxon-name></italic> with <italic><tp:taxon-name>Eucyclops</tp:taxon-name></italic> Claus, 1893 and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Ectocylops</tp:taxon-name></italic> Brady, 1904, which belong to a completely different subfamily. The subfamiliar division of <tp:taxon-name>Cyclopidae</tp:taxon-name> is well supported both by morphological and molecular evidence (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Karanovic and Krajicek 2012a</xref>).
            </p>
            <p>A proper revision of the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops</tp:taxon-name></italic>/<italic><tp:taxon-name>Acanthocyclops</tp:taxon-name></italic> group would require redescriptions of almost 200 nominal species. In addition, evidence for cryptic speciation in some of the more widely distributed taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Monchenko 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Karanovic and Krajicek 2012b</xref>), a common phenomenon in freshwater cyclopoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Bláha et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Karanovic and Krajicek 2012a</xref>), must be taken into account. Recent molecular work has suggested polyphyly even of a morphologically well-defined group of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops</tp:taxon-name></italic> species inhabiting the subterranean waters of a well-defined region of Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Karanovic and Krajicek 2012b</xref>). Unfortunately, most of the species of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops</tp:taxon-name></italic> have been described from subterranean habitats, from very few specimens, and for some the types are no longer extant or are impossible to trace. All of this makes a comprehensive revision more difficult to accomplish. Some initial attempts have been made, however, to separate obviously unrelated species into newly established genera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Lescher-Moutoué 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">Reid et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">Reid and Ishida 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Karanovic 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Karanovic et al. 2012</xref>a). The general agreement among taxonomists seems to be that the genus must be split into several monophyletic lineages, many of which are recognised as species groups today (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">Reid and Strayer 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Pesce 1996</xref>), but also that it must be revised together with the closely related genus <italic><tp:taxon-name>Acanthocyclops</tp:taxon-name></italic>.
            </p>
            <p>In this paper we deal with one such species-group from Korea and Japan, which is characterized by an 11-segmented antennula and a swimming legs segmentation formula of 2/2, 3/2, 3/3, 3/3 (exopod/endopod). This group is usually referred to by the name of its oldest described species, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops languidoides</tp:taxon-name></italic>. The <italic>languidoides</italic>-group contains today about one half of all the nominal species and subspecies of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops</tp:taxon-name></italic> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Monchenko and von Vaupel Klein 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Dussart and Defaye 2006</xref>). These copepods are distributed all over the Holarctic region and are especially diverse in subterranean habitats. Only four species were known previously from Japan: the widely distributed (Palearctic) <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops languidoides</tp:taxon-name></italic> and the supposedly endemic <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops japonicus</tp:taxon-name></italic> Ito, 1952, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops suoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> Ito, 1954, and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops brevifurcus</tp:taxon-name></italic> Ishida, 2006 (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Ito 1952</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">Ueda et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Ishida 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Ishida (2002)</xref> did not cover subterranean taxa in his illustrated <!--PageBreak-->fauna of the freshwater cyclopoids of Japan, and thus did not mention either <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops japonicus</tp:taxon-name></italic> or <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops suoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic>. He provided a drawing of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacylops</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. B, which he subsequently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Ishida 2006</xref>) described as <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops brevifurcus</tp:taxon-name></italic>, and also some drawings of specimens that he assigned to <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops nanus</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Sars, 1863), which undoubtedly belong to <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops languidoides</tp:taxon-name></italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Lee et al. (2007)</xref> reported two females of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops suoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> from Korea (repeated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Chang 2009</xref>), but noted quite a few morphological differences from the Japanese population. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Chang (2009)</xref> reported the widely distributed <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops languidoides</tp:taxon-name></italic> from numerous localities in Korea, as the only other member of the <italic>languidoides</italic>-group here.
            </p>
            <p>The Korean Peninsula is a terrain of low mountains, built mostly of Precambrian rocks, although Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic deposits can be found in many isolated pockets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Lee 1999</xref>). Most of the carbonate rocks in Korea are lower Paleozoic (Cambrian to Ordovician) in age and formed in shallow marine environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Choi and Chough 2005</xref>). These sediments are suitable for the formation of subterranean voids, representing an ideal habitat for stygofauna (aquatic subterranean fauna), and more than 1000 caves have been explored so far in Korea, some being as much as 10 km long (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">Woo et al. 2005</xref>). Until recently, copepods in general have been poorly studied in these habitats, and the few available records indicate mostly the presence of species already described from Japan, with very few endemic elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Chang 2009</xref>). Connections between the Korean and Japanese freshwater faunas are indeed very strong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Okazaki et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Park et al. 2006</xref>), since the two countries were connected by land bridges several times during the Pleistocene glacial cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Lihova et al. 2010</xref>). However, relative isolation of carbonate pockets makes for an enormous speciation potential, and we expected a high level of short-range endemism in the <italic>languidoides</italic>-group, similar to what is seen in harpacticoid copepods there (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Karanovic and Lee 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Karanovic et al. 2012b</xref>). Surface-water <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops</tp:taxon-name></italic> are more widely distributed, with no endemic species in Korea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Chang 2009</xref>).

            <p>Specimens of the Korean new species were collected by staff of the National Institute of Biological Resources either by the Karaman-Chappuis method, i.e. digging a pit in sandy sediment and decanting through a plankton hand-net (mesh size 38 μm) the water that drains in, or using a phreatic pump. All specimens from Japan collected by senior author were collected by the Karaman-Chappuis method. Animals were fixed in 99% ethanol. Locality data and number of specimens are given in the type material section of the new species below. All Korean types are deposited at the National Institute of Biological Resources, Incheon, while all Japanese types are deposited at the Lake Biwa Museum, Kusatsu.</p>
            <p>Specimens were dissected and mounted on microscope slides in Faure’s medium, which was prepared following the procedure discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">Stock and von Vaupel Klein (1996)</xref>, and dissected appendages were then covered by a coverslip. For the urosome or the entire animal, two human hairs were mounted between the slide and coverslip, so the parts would not be compressed. By manipulating the coverslip carefully by hand, <!--PageBreak-->the whole animal or a particular appendage could be positioned in different aspects, making possible the observation of morphological details. During the examination the water slowly evaporates and the appendages eventually remain in a completely dry Faure’s medium, ready for long-term storage. All line drawings were prepared using a drawing tube attached to a Leica MB2500 phase-interference compound microscope, equipped with N-PLAN (5×, 10×, 20×, 40× and 63× dry) or PL FLUOTAR (100x oil) objectives. Specimens that were not drawn were examined in propylene glycol and, after examination, were again preserved in 99.9% ethanol. Specimens for scanning electron micrography (SEM) were dehydrated in progressive ethanol concentrations, transferred into pure isoamyl-acetate, critical-point dried, mounted on stubs, coated in gold, and observed under a HITACHI S-2380N microscope on the in-lens detector, with an accelerating voltage of 8 kV; black and white photographs were taken on film (Kodak Tri-X 400 pro) and subsequently scanned.</p>
            <p>Morphological terminology follows <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Huys and Boxshall (1991)</xref>, except for the numbering of the setae of the caudal rami and small differences in the spelling of some appendages (antennula, mandibula, maxillula instead of antennule, mandible, maxillule), as an attempt to standardise the terminology for homologous appendages in different crustacean groups. Biospeleological terminology follows <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Humphreys (2000)</xref>. Sensilla and pores on all somites (body segments) were numbered consecutively from the anterior to posterior part of the body and from the dorsal to ventral side, to aid in the recognition of serially homologous structures and future comparisons with other species; they are not intended as a novel terminology. Only the first presented species is described in full, while all subsequent descriptions are shortened by making them comparative.

Total body length, measured from tip of rostrum to posterior margin of caudal rami (excluding caudal setae), from 450 to 482 µm (453 µm in holotype). Preserved specimens colourless; no live specimens observed. Integument relatively weakly sclerotised, smooth, without cuticular pits or cuticular windows. Surface ornamentation of somites consisting of 92 pairs and seven unpaired (mid-dorsal) pores and sensilla (numbered with Arabic numerals consecutively from anterior to posterior end of body, and from dorsal to ventral side in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>; but illustrated in more detail for male specimens, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>); no spinules except on anal somite, caudal rami, and appendages. Habitus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>) relatively robust, not dorso-ventrally compressed, with prosome/urosome length ratio 1.3 and greatest width in dorsal view at posterior end of cephalothorax. Body length/width ratio about 3 (dorsal view); cephalothorax 2.1 times as wide as genital double-somite. Free pedigerous somites without lateral or dorsal expansions, all connected by well developed arthrodial membranes and all with narrow and smooth hyaline fringes. Pleural areas of cephalothorax and free pedigerous somites relatively well developed, covering insertions of cephalic appendages and praecoxae and partly covering coxae of swimming legs in lateral view.
                        </p>
                        <p>Rostrum well developed, membranous, not demarcated at base, broadly rounded and furnished with single frontal pair of sensilla (no. 1).</p>
                        <p>Cephalothorax (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>) large, 1.1 times as long as its greatest width (dorsal view), narrower at anterior part and perfectly oval; representing 38% of total body length. Surface of cephalic shield ornamented with three unpaired mid-dorsal sensilla and pores (nos. 5, 8, 55) and 56 pairs of long sensilla and small cuticular pores (nos. 2-5, 6, 7, 9-54, 56-60); pores and sensilla 39-60 belonging to first pedigerous somite, latter being incorporated into cephalothorax.

Copulatory pore very small, oval, situated ventrally at about midlength of double-somite; copulatory duct narrow, siphon-shaped, weakly sclerotised. Seminal receptacle characteristically shaped, with relatively large anterior expansion, constriction at midlength, and shorter but broader posterior expansion, altogether representing 49% of double-somite’s length.

                        <p>This species is probably most closely related to <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops brevifurcus</tp:taxon-name></italic> Ishida, 2006, which was described from Kyoto on the other side of Mount Hiei, in a parallel drainage basin to that of Lake Biwa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Ishida 2006</xref>), and from Lake Biwa itself. The description of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops brevifurcus</tp:taxon-name></italic> was quite lacking in detail, so we redecribed it after examining the holotype specimen dissected on one slide and four specimens from Lake Biwa (see below). <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops brevifurcus</tp:taxon-name></italic> shares with <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops ishidai</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n. the shape of the caudal rami, which are unusually short for the <italic>languidoides</italic>-group, and have an extremely large ventral protuberance on the distal margin with a pore on the tip. Both species also share exactly the same armature formula of all swimming legs as well as an identical pattern of cuticular pores and sensilla on all somites. Differences between the two include: relative length of the innermost terminal caudal seta, number of setae on the mandibular palp, relative length of the apical spine on the third leg endopod, number of rows of spinules on the intercoxal sclerite of the fourth leg, shape of the inner-distal margin of the fourth leg basis, and proportions of the distal segment of the fifth leg (all these arrowed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figs 7</xref>, 8), as well as the armature of the antenna (with an exopodal seta present and only seven setae each on the second and third exopodal segments in <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops brevifurcus</tp:taxon-name></italic>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Ishida (2006)</xref> illustrated two setae on the basis of the maxilliped in <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops brevifurcus</tp:taxon-name></italic>, but only one is present in the holotype (arrowed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7F</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Ishida (2002)</xref> partly illustrated a specimen from Lake Biwa under the name <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. B, which he later (2006) attributed to <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops brevifurcus</tp:taxon-name></italic> (see the synonymy section below). We examined the four extant specimens from this series and agree that they are conspecific with <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops brevifurcus</tp:taxon-name></italic> (see below). Ishida erroneously illustrated the antenna of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. B with only six setae on the second endopodal segment, and the antennula with only ten segments, but he later corrected himself in the description of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops brevifurcus</tp:taxon-name></italic>.

                        <p>Only four other species of the <italic>languidoides</italic>-group have similarly short caudal rami: <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops ichnusae</tp:taxon-name></italic> Pesce &amp; Galassi, 1985 from Sardinia; <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops ichnusoides</tp:taxon-name></italic> Petkovski &amp; Karanovic, 1997 from the ancient Lake Ohrid; <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops improcerus</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Mazepova, 1950) and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops versutus</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Mazepova, 1962) from the ancient Lake Baikal (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Mazepova 1950</xref>, 1962; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">Pesce and Galassi 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">Petkovski and Karanovic 1997</xref>). Unfortunately, all four were described based on a limited set of morphological characters, and many features cannot be compared with those of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops ishidai</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops brevifurcus</tp:taxon-name></italic>. Five out of these six species come from or near ancient lakes, a distribution pattern commonly associated with Tertiary relics. <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops ishidai</tp:taxon-name></italic> has a shorter dorsal caudal seta and a more rounded seminal receptacle than <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops ichnusae</tp:taxon-name></italic>, longer caudal rami and third endopodal segment of the fourth leg than <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops improcerus</tp:taxon-name></italic>, a more slender habitus, longer female antennula, and shorter inner spine on the male sixth leg than <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops versutus</tp:taxon-name></italic>, and a shorter dorsal caudal seta, no exopodal seta on the antenna, and a longer third endopodal segment of the fourth leg than <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops ichnusoides</tp:taxon-name></italic>.

                        <p>Other material: three females in ethanol (LBM 1430000888) and one female dissected on one slide (LBM 1430005384) from Japan, Shiga prefecture, Takashima city, Makinocho-Kaizu district, Lake Biwa on western side of Kaizu Ohsaki point, between near-shore boulders, 07 March 1994, leg. T. Ishida. Note: Consultation of original field data maintained at the Lake Biwa Museum showed that the the municipality (town) mentioned by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Ishida (2006)</xref>, viz., Nishiazai, was erroneous and that the collection site is actually in what was then the Kaizu district of Makino town.

                        <p>The specimens from Lake Biwa show several features in the mouthparts that differ from those observed in the holotype. They have two long setae on the mandibular palp, two setae on the proximal endite of the maxilla, two setae on the basis of the maxilliped, and three setae on the syncoxa of the maxilliped. All other features agree well with those of the holotype, including the length of the innermost terminal caudal seta, armature of the antenna, shape of the notch on the fourth leg basis, and shape of the fifth leg exopod. The specimens from Lake Biwa have ten teeth and six or seven spinules on the labrum, and the same pattern of cuticular sensilla and <!--PageBreak-->pores on the somites as that in <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops ishidai</tp:taxon-name></italic>, but most of these characters cannot be compared with the holotype.

                        <p>This is probably a surface-water species, but its morphological similarity to the newly described <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops ishidai</tp:taxon-name></italic> (see above) warranted its re-examination and inclusion in this paper. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Ishida (2006)</xref> described it from a single female from Mizoro-ga-ike pond in Kyoto, and we redescribe it here based on an examination of the same holotype, mounted on one slide. In the same work, Ishida reported another three damaged females from Lake Biwa, but as other material examined, not as paratypes. We had a chance to examine this material as well and found four females in the vial, only one of which was in poor condition (with the posterior part of the usorome missing). We dissected one of them on one slide, while the others were examined undissected. All four specimens are indeed conspecific with <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops brevifurcus</tp:taxon-name></italic> Ishida, 2006, but with several differences in the mouth appendages (see variability above). It is hard to assess whether these differences are a result of geographical variation, or are just an abnormality in the holotype, because only one specimen from Mizoro-ga-ike pond was collected. <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops brevifurcus</tp:taxon-name></italic> is probably most closely related to <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops ishidai</tp:taxon-name></italic>, which we collected in the interstitial of two localities on the banks of the Daido River, which joins the Seta River, Lake Biwa’s outflow, several kilometers below the outflow point and is then part of the same water system as the lake. The morphological similarities and differences between these two species are outlined in the Remarks section for <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops ishidai</tp:taxon-name></italic> (see above).

Preserved specimens colourless; no live specimens observed. Integument relatively weakly sclerotised, smooth, without cuticular pits or cuticular windows. Surface ornamentation of somites consisting of 40 pairs and three unpaired (mid-dorsal) pores and sensilla (those probably homologous with those of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops ishidai</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n.indicated with same Arabic numerals; presumably novel pairs indicated with Roman numbers and numbered consecutively from anterior to posterior end of body, and from dorsal to ventral side in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figs 9A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10A, B, C</xref>); no spinules except on anal somite, caudal rami, and appendages. Habitus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9A, B</xref>) relatively slender, not dorso-ventrally compressed, with prosome/urosome length ratio 1.5 and greatest width in dorsal view at first third of cephalothorax, body prominently arched backwards between prosome and urosome.

                        <p><italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops parasuoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n. can be easily distinguished from the Japanese <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops suoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops pseudosuoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n. by the size of the dorsal caudal seta, as well as by the proportions of many armature elements and the ornamentation of most appendages. Most of these differences are arrowed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Figs 14</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15"></xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F16"></xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F17">17</xref>. However, very few differences in the pattern of pores and sensilla and the similar armature of the antenna in <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops parasuoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops suoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> probably indicate that these two species are not distantly related, and may form a monophyletic group together with <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops pseudosuoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops hisuta</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n. They are all only remotely related to <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops ishidai</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n., <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops brevifurcus</tp:taxon-name></italic>, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops leeae</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n., <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops hanguk</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n., and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops parahanguk</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n.
                        </p>
                        <p>It is quite clear that <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops parasuoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> forms a sibling species pair with the Japanese <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops hisuta</tp:taxon-name></italic> (see below), and they can only be distinguished at this stage by the habitus shape (much more slender in <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops parasuoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic>). We described <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops hisuta</tp:taxon-name></italic> for a population reported and partly described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">Ueda et al. (1996)</xref> under the name <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops suoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> (see synonymy below). Unfortunately, the description and illustrations they provide do not show details of any mouth appendages or the armature of the first three swimming legs, so many characters cannot be compared. If we assume these features are very similar to those of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops suoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> as illustrated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Ito (1957)</xref>, who provided drawings of all swimming legs, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops hisuta</tp:taxon-name></italic> would differ from <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops parasuoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> additionally by the number of inner setae on the second endopodal segment of the first leg. This, however, remains speculative until <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops hisuta</tp:taxon-name></italic> is properly redescribed.
                        </p>
                        <p>A great number of species (and subspecies) in the <italic>languidoides</italic>-group have been described based on a very limited set of characters, giving us no opportunity to compare fine details of the somite sensilla and pores pattern or the appendages ornamentation. This species-group was for a long time considered a single widely-distributed species, although some authors noticed a high level of morphological variability even in a small <!--PageBreak-->geographic area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Ito 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Kiefer 1968</xref>). Even today, some authors consider as valid no fewer than 14 subspecies (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Dussart and Defaye 2006</xref>), many of them with overlapping ranges. It was <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">Petkovski (1984)</xref> who first realized that most of these subspecies must be distinct biological species, after he found three of them occurring sympatrically in a single interstitial sample from Slovenia. He illustrated their major differences in caudal rami shape and ornamentation, shape of the genital double-somite and its seminal receptacle, and proportions of the third endopodal segment of the fourth leg and its apical spines. Since then these particular characters have normally been illustrated for new, presumably closely related taxa, while other features have not been studied in detail. Thus, most comparisons between different taxa in this species-group have to be inferred today from these three characters, especially the shape and armature of the caudal rami. Somewhat similar caudal rami to those of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops parasuoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> are found in the following European species: <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops clandestinus</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Kiefer, 1926), <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops cristinae</tp:taxon-name></italic> Pesce &amp; Galassi, 1987, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops eriophori</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Gurney, 1927), <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops hypnicola</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Gurney, 1927), <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops insularis</tp:taxon-name></italic> Monchenko, 1982, and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops paolae</tp:taxon-name></italic> Pesce &amp; Galassi, 1987 (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Gurney 1927</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Herbst 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Kiefer 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">Pesce and Maggi 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Monchenko 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">Petkovski 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">Pesce and Galassi 1987a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Galassi 1991</xref>). In all of these species, some small differences from <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops parasuoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> can, however, be discerned in the proportions and armature of the caudal rami. Also, none of them has such elongated lateral arms of the anterior part of seminal receptacle, and most also differ from <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops parasuoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> in some other significant morphological characters. For example, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops insularis</tp:taxon-name></italic> has eight setae on the second endopodal segment of the antenna, and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops cristinae</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops hypnicola</tp:taxon-name></italic> have an exopodal seta on the antenna.

Total body length, measured from tip of rostrum to posterior margin of caudal rami (excluding caudal setae), from 391 to 473 µm (391 µm in holotype). Preserved specimens colourless; no live specimens observed. Integument relatively weakly sclerotised, smooth, without cuticular pits or cuticular windows. Surface ornamentation of somites very similar to that of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops parasuoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic>, consisting of 38 pairs of pores and sensilla (those probably homologous with those of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops ishidai</tp:taxon-name></italic> indicated with same Arabic numerals in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Fig. 15A, B, C</xref>); no spinules except on anal somite, caudal rami, and appendages.

                        <p>This record extends the known distribution of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops suoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> more than 290 km eastward. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Ito (1954)</xref> described it from Tsunoshima island in the Yamaguchi prefecture, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Ito (1957)</xref> later reported it from Yoshida in Hiroshima prefecture, some 170 km east-northeast of the type locality. All three localities are on Honshu, which is the largest island in Japan. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Ito (1957)</xref> also reported and illustrated a population of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops suoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> from Amami-Oshima island, some 650 km south of the type locality. Here we describe this last population as the new species <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops pseudosuoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> (see below). Although they form a sibling species pair, the two can be distinguished easily by the relative length of the innermost terminal caudal seta, as well as by the length of the apical spines on the fourth leg endopod. No other species of the <italic>languidoides-</italic>group has such long dorsal caudal setae as <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops suoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> or <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops pseudosuoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic>, except perhaps <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops pelagonicus</tp:taxon-name></italic> Petkovski, 1971 from Macedonia (although slightly shorter; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">Petkovski 1971</xref>). This Balkan species also has a similar general shape of the seminal receptacle and fifth leg, but can be distinguished easily from its two East Asian congeners by the absence of an inner seta on the first exopodal segment of all swimming legs.

                        <p><italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops suoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> can be distinguished from the Korean <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops parasuoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n. by the size of the dorsal caudal seta, as well as by the proportions of many armature elements and the ornamentation of most appendages.

The very few differences in the patterm of pores and sensilla, and the identical armature of the antenna, however, probably indicate that these two species are not distantly related, and may form a monophyletic group together with <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops pseudosuoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops hisuta</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n.

                        <p>This species is most similar to <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops suoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> but can be distinguished by the longer innermost terminal caudal setae, which are slightly longer than the outermost terminal caudal ones, as well as by the longer apical endopodal spines on the fourth leg. Both species share very long dorsal caudal setae, which are about twice as long as the caudal rami and thus unique in the <italic>languidoides</italic>-group. Although the original description of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops suoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Ito (1954)</xref> was brief, after our redescription of it herein based on the Lake Biwa material (see above), we can confirm that it and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops pseudosuoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n. share many other morphological features. Among these are the armature formula of all swimming legs, similar proportions of the caudal rami, and similar proportions of the segments and armature of the fifth leg. Unfortunately, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Ito (1957)</xref> did not describe or illustrate the antenna or mouth appendages, and he illustrated only the segments (without armature elements) of the antennula, so these features cannot be compared. Note that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Ito (1957</xref>: fig. 45) provided a drawing of the female genital double-somite that is actually taken from his earlier publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Ito 1954</xref>) and does not pertain to the Amami-Oshima population.

                        <p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">Ueda et al. (1996)</xref> stated that they identified the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops</tp:taxon-name></italic> population from Akiyoshido cave as <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops suoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> mainly based on the shape of its seminal receptacle, but they noted four significant morphological differences between their specimens and the two populations described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Ito (1954</xref>, 1957). Their decision could have been motivated by the fact that Akiyoshido cave lies only 40 km east-southeast from the type locality of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops suoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic>, and that <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops suoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> was also found much further east by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Ito (1957)</xref>. In our view, the differences already noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">Ueda et al. (1996)</xref> justify the erection of a new species. Not only does <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops hisuta</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n. differ from <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops suoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> in the length of the dorsal caudal setae, proportions of the caudal rami, proportions of the genital double-somite, and size of the innermost terminal caudal setae, but it has all these characters in common with the Korean <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops parasuoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n. (see above), in addition to slender and very elongated lateral arms of the seminal receptacle. It is quite clear that <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops hisuta</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops parasuoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> form a sibling species pair, and they can only be distinguished at this stage by the habitus shape (much more slender in <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops parasuoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic>). It is possible that they also differ in the number of inner setae on the second endopodal segment of the first leg, if we assume that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">Ueda et al. (1996)</xref> found the armature formula of the population from Akiyoshido cave to be the same as that reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Ito (1957)</xref>. Unfortunately, the description and illustrations provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">Ueda et al. (1996)</xref> do not show details of any mouth appendage or the armature of the first three pairs of swimming legs, so many characters cannot be compared.

(2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Chang (2009)</xref> stated that they identified the Korean <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops</tp:taxon-name></italic> populations from Ondal-gul cave and the Youncheon-gul lava tube (the latter represented by an unillustrated female) as <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops suoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> Ito, 1954 mainly based on the shape of the seminal receptacle and the elongated dorsal caudal setae. They noted, however, that the dorsal caudal setae are not as elongated as in Japanese populations and also that the caudal rami have somewhat different proportions. Their taxonomic decision possibly reflects the fact that various previous records of this species indicated a wide range in Japan, as well as some variability in the proportions and armature of the caudal rami (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Ito 1954</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">Ueda et al. 1996</xref>).
                        </p>
                        <p>After the redescription of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops suoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> from Japan in this paper (see above), it is quite clear that the Korean specimens found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Lee et al. (2007)</xref> are not conspecific with it. Thus, we describe them as a new species, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops leeae</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n. The two species are, in fact, only distantly related, which can be judged from their numerous morphological differences in the proportions of the genital double-somite, proportions of the caudal rami, length of the dorsal caudal seta, length of the innermost terminal caudal seta, presence/absence of an exopodal seta on the antenna, number of setae on the second endopodal segment of antenna, etc. The armature of the antenna of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops leeae</tp:taxon-name></italic> probably indicates that this species is not even part of the morphological group formed by the Korean <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops parasuoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n. and the Japanese <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops suoensis, D. pseudosuoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n., and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops hisuta</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n. (see above).
                        </p>
                        <p><italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops leeae</tp:taxon-name></italic> differs from <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops parasuoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> in the following characters: proportions ot the genital double-somite, proportions of the caudal rami, length of the dorsal caudal <!--PageBreak-->seta, length of the innermost terminal caudal seta, presence/absence of exopodal seta on the antenna, number of setae on the second endopodal segment of antenna, length of the proximal seta on the third endopodal segment of the third swimming leg, length of the proximal seta on the third endopodal segment of the fourth swimming leg, relative length of the apical spines on the third endopodal segment of the fourth swimming leg, number of spinule rows on the intercoxal sclerite of the fourth leg, and proportions of the distal segment of the fifth leg. Unfortunately, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Lee et al. (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Chang (2009)</xref> did not illustrate mouth appendages, so details of these limbs cannot be compared.
                        </p>
                        <p><italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops leeae</tp:taxon-name></italic> seems to be more closely related to <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops languidoides</tp:taxon-name></italic> than to <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops parasuoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic>. The former species has been recorded from numerous surface-water and subterranean habitats in Korea (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Chang 2009</xref>) and is widely distributed in the Palearctic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Dussart and Defaye 2006</xref>). <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops languidoides</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops leeae</tp:taxon-name></italic> share the same armature and ornamentation of the antenna, as well as a similar ornamentation of the fourth leg (especially its coxa and intercoxal sclerite). This may indicate that they shared a recent common ancestor, or even that the stygophilic <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops languidoides</tp:taxon-name></italic> gave rise (i.e. is directly ancestral) to the stygobiotic <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops leeae</tp:taxon-name></italic> during the major oscillations of its wide distributional range that probably took place during the Pleistocene glacial cycles. This would explain the presence of a population of the <italic>languidoides</italic>-group in a lava tube on the volcanic Jeju Island, although we cannot be sure if it truly belongs to <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops leeae</tp:taxon-name></italic> since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Lee et al. (2007)</xref> did not provide any illustrations of this population. These inter-relationships need to be studied further, using molecular methods in addition to comparative morphology. The two species mainly differ in the proportions of the caudal rami (longer in <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops languidoides</tp:taxon-name></italic>) and the relative length of the third endopodal segment of the fourth leg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Chang 2009</xref>). However, the very wide distribution of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops languidoides</tp:taxon-name></italic>, with numerous described subspecies (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Dussart and Defaye 2006</xref>) and several reports of its extreme morphological variability both from Asia (i.e. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Ito 1954</xref>) and Europe (i.e <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Kiefer 1968</xref>), probably indicate that it is a complex of species, as is the case for many other widely distributed freshwater cyclopoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Monchenko 2000</xref>; Blàha et al. 2010; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Karanovic and Krajicek 2012a</xref>).
                        </p>
                        <p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Chang (2009)</xref> reported records of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops suoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> from four different localities in Korea in addition to Odal-gul cave and the Yoncheon-gul lava tube, but without any additional comments on morphological variability, and he only republished the drawings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Lee et al. (2007)</xref>. It is thus impossible for us to confirm whether any of these populations is in fact conspecific with <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops leeae</tp:taxon-name></italic> or perhaps with <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops parasuoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic>.

                        <p>Female (based on holotype and four paratypes from type locality). Total body length, measured from tip of rostrum to posterior margin of caudal rami (excluding caudal setae), from 412 to 445 µm (440 µm in holotype). Preserved specimens colourless; no live specimens observed. Integument relatively weakly sclerotised, smooth, without cuticular pits or cuticular windows. Surface ornamentation of somites consisting of 44 pairs of sensilla and pores and four unpaired (mid-dorsal) pores (those pores and sensilla probably homologous with those of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops ishidai</tp:taxon-name></italic> indicated with same Arabic numerals; those homologous with those of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops parasuoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> indicated with Roman numerals; presumably novel pores and sensilla indicated with Greek letters consecutively from anterior to posterior end of body, and from dorsal to ventral side in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F18">Figs 18A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F19">19A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F20">20A, B, C</xref>); no spinules except on anal somite, caudal rami, and appendages. Habitus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F18">Fig. 18A, B</xref>) relatively slender, only slightly dorso-ventrally compressed, with prosome/urosome length ratio 1.4 and greatest width in dorsal view <!--PageBreak-->at first third of cephalothorax, body prominently arched backwards between prosome and urosome. Body length/width ratio about 3.3 (dorsal view); cephalothorax 1.84 times as wide as genital double-somite. Free pedigerous somites without lateral or dorsal expansions, all connected by well developed arthrodial membranes and having narrow and smooth hyaline fringes. Pleural areas of cephalothorax and free pediger<!--PageBreak-->ous somites very short, not covering insertions of cephalic appendages or praecoxae of swimming legs in lateral view.
                        </p>
                        <p>Rostrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F19">Fig. 19A, B</xref>) well developed, membranous, not demarcated at base, broadly rounded and furnished with one pair of frontal sensilla (no. 1).

Copulatory pore small, oval, situated at about 3/5 of genital double-somite ventrally; copulatory duct relatively wide, siphon-shaped and directed anteriorly, weakly sclerotised. Hyaline fringe wavy, not serrated. Seminal receptacle anvil-shaped, with relatively short anterior expansion and long lateral arms, constricted at middle, and with equally long and wide posterior expansion, together representing 52% of double-somite’s length; ovipores situated dorso-laterally at midlength of double-somite, covered by reduced sixth legs.

                        <p><italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops hanguk</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n. belongs to the <italic>languidoides</italic>-group based on its 11-segmented antennula and the swimming leg segmentation formula (exopod/endopod) 2/2, 3/2, 3/3, 3/3. Detailed examination of the pattern of pores and sensilla on the somites and the armature of the mouth appendages show that this species is only distantly related to all other East Asian species of this species-group except for <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops parahanguk</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n. from Japan (see below). It it quite clear that the two form a sibling species pair, with their extremely short caudal rami and genital double somite, extremely wide anal operculum, almost identical pattern of pores and sensilla on all somites, minute innermost terminal caudal seta, long dorsal caudal seta, wider than long eighth segment of the antennula, extremely reduced armature formula of the antenna (1.1.5.7), single seta on the mandibular palp, identical armature formula of the swimming legs (with only three inner setae on the second endopodal segment of the first leg), extremely short third endopodal segment of the fourth leg, and progressively longer setae from the outer side on the third exopodal segment of the fourth leg. The two species can be distinguished by their habitus, armature of the maxillipedal basis, ornamentation of the labrum and antennal basis, relative length of the aesthetasc on the eighth antennular segment, small differences in the shape of the seminal receptacle, genital double-somite, and caudal rami, and relative lengths of the dorsal caudal seta and inner apical spine on the third endopodal segment of the fourth leg (all these arrowed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F23">Figs 23</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F24"></xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F25">25</xref>). Additionally, small differences were observed in the pattern of pores and sensilla, with sensilla no. 21 less widely spaced in <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops hanguk</tp:taxon-name></italic>.
                        </p>
                        <p>No other species of the <italic>languidoides-</italic>group, nor any other species of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops</tp:taxon-name></italic>, has such short caudal rami and minute innermost terminal caudal setae. These characters are traditionally only found in much more reduced cyclopoids (usually with variously reduced fifth legs), such as members of the genus <italic><tp:taxon-name>Itocyclops</tp:taxon-name></italic> Reid &amp; Ishida, 2000 from Japan and North America (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">Reid and Ishida 2000</xref>). It would be easy to speculate how this monospecific genus could have originated from an acestor similar to <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops hanguk</tp:taxon-name></italic> through a series of reductions in both the swimming leg segmentation and the armature and segmentation of the fifth leg, if <italic><tp:taxon-name>Itocyclops</tp:taxon-name></italic> did not exibit a more plesiomorphic armature of the antenna and maxilliped.
                        </p>
                        <p>The only other described <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops</tp:taxon-name></italic> with similarly short caudal rami is the Romanian <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops languidoides spelaeus</tp:taxon-name></italic> Pleşa, 1956. This species does not even belong to the <italic>languidoides</italic>-group, as is shown by the three-segmented exopod of its first leg (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">Pleşa 1956</xref>), even though <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Dussart and Defaye (2006)</xref> recently still listed it as a subspecies of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops languidoides</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Lilljeborg, 1901). The latter authors mentioned that <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops languidoides spelaeus</tp:taxon-name></italic> could be a junior synonym of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops stygius deminutus</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Chappuis, 1925), following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Monchenko (1974)</xref>, but this is just a speculation until both taxa are properly redescribed. Both differ from <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops hanguk</tp:taxon-name></italic> by the segmentation of the swimming legs, and by their much longer innermost terminal caudal seta.

            <p>Morphological study of microcharacters, many of which are used here in cyclopoid taxonomy for the first time, has revealed a high diversity of the <italic>languidoides</italic>-group of the genus <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops</tp:taxon-name></italic> both in Korea and Japan. No subterranean species was found in common, although some may belong to the same or similar lineages, indicating relatively recent speciation. We have described seven new species of stygobionts, and discovered four sibling species pairs (two in Japan, and two in Korea and Japan). Three new species were described from Korea (<italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops hanguk</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n., <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops leeae</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n., and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops parasuoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n.), and four from Japan (<italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops hisuta</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n., <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops ishidai</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n., <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops parahanguk</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n., and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops pseudosuoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n.). <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops hanguk</tp:taxon-name></italic>, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops parasuoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic>, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops ishidai</tp:taxon-name></italic>, and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops parahanguk</tp:taxon-name></italic> were described from newly collected material, while the other three new names were erected for populations of previously reported specimens identified by their discoverers as some of the more widely distributed species. <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops brevifurcus</tp:taxon-name></italic> Ishida, 2006 was redescribed from the holotype female, while <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops suoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> Ito, 1954 was redescribed from newly collected material near the ancient Lake Biwa in Japan. Our initial hypothesis about high endemism of this group of subterranean animals was confirmed, and is in accordance with recently discovered endemism of subterranean harpacticoids in this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Karanovic and Lee 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Karanovic et al. 2012b</xref>). This research provides evidence for both the importance of subterranean habitats as reservoirs of biodiversity, and current inadequate morphological methods of identifying closely related species of cyclopoid copepods. The disproportionately high diversity discovered around Lake Biwa provides further evidence in support of the hypothesis about the role of ancient lakes as biodiversity pumps for subterranean habitats, which was first proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Karanovic and Abe (2010)</xref>.
            </p>
            <p>All nine species of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops</tp:taxon-name></italic> described or redescribed in this paper belong to the <italic>languidoides-</italic>group, based on the segmentation of their swimming legs and female antennula. Considering that they all come from a well-defined zoogeographical region, it would be reasonable to expect that they are also closely related; however, careful examination of the pattern of pores and sensilla on their somites, as well as the armature and ornamentation of their antennae and mouth appendages, all suggest that this is not a closely related group at all. There is no question that the Korean <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops hanguk</tp:taxon-name></italic> and the Japanese <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops parahanguk</tp:taxon-name></italic> are very closely related, as are the Korean <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops parasuoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> and the Japanese <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops hisuta</tp:taxon-name></italic>, but the relationship between the <italic>hanguk/parahanguk</italic> pair and the <italic>parasuoensis/hisuta</italic> pair is quite remote. In fact, the <italic>hanguk/parahanguk</italic> pair has a somewhat isolated position in the <italic>languidoides</italic>-group, while the <italic>parasuoensis/hisuta</italic> pair is probably more closely related to several European species than to any of their East Asian congeners (see Remarks sections for the respective species above). The other two sibling species pairs are all Japanese endemics: <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops brevifurcus</tp:taxon-name></italic> from surface waters in Kyoto and Lake Biwa is very closely related to the subterranean <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops ishidai</tp:taxon-name></italic> from the vicinity of Lake Biwa, while <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops suoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> from central and western Honshu is a sibling species of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops pseudosuoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> from the southern island of Amami-Oshima (both subter<!--PageBreak-->ranean; see above). These four sibling species pairs probably represent four separate colonization events in the subterranean waters of East Asia from more widely distributed (probably Palaearctic) surface water ancestors, as they are not closely related to each other, and some of them have relatives in highly disjunct locations, without direct subterranean connections or plausible mechanisms of long distance dispersal. Actually, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops brevifurcus</tp:taxon-name></italic> still lives in surface-water habitats, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Ishida (2006)</xref> collected one female from the floating bog bed at Mizoro-ga-ike pond and four females from surface water of Lake Biwa. The Korean <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops leeae</tp:taxon-name></italic> probably represents a fifth colonization event in East Asia, as it seems to be most closely related to the widely distributed <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops languidoides</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Lilljeborg, 1901), and the Japanese <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops japonicus</tp:taxon-name></italic> Ito, 1952 probably represents a sixth. A relatively remote relationship among these six species groups of East Asian <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops</tp:taxon-name></italic> is further supported by their ability to live sympatrically, and Korean members of different groups were often found in the same sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F27">Fig. 27</xref>). The fact that the size differentiation between them is not pronounced probably indicates that they are not competing for the same resources, which all points to different phylogenies and repeated colonizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Karanovic and Cooper 2012</xref>). The existence of very few differences in the pattern of pores and sensilla and the similar armature of the antenna in <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops parasuoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops suoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> probably indicate that these two species are not very distantly related, and may form a monophyletic group together with <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops pseudosuoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops hisuta</tp:taxon-name></italic> (and probably some European species). On the other hand, the pattern of pores and sensilla suggests that they are all only remotely related to <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops ishidai</tp:taxon-name></italic>, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops brevifurcus</tp:taxon-name></italic>, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops leeae</tp:taxon-name></italic>, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops hanguk</tp:taxon-name></italic>, and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops parahanguk</tp:taxon-name></italic>. Future studies of this species complex in East Asia will have to include molecular tools to test this hypothesis.
            </p>
            <p>The highest concentration of subterranean species of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops</tp:taxon-name></italic> in East Asia is found around the ancient Lake Biwa in Japan. Two of the more widely distributed Japanese species (<italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops suoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops japonicus</tp:taxon-name></italic>) have ranges that include this area and extend further either southwards (<italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops suoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic>) or northwards (<italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops japonicus</tp:taxon-name></italic>), while three species appear to be endemic to this small area of Honshu around Lake Biwa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F28">Fig. 28</xref>). This is probably not a coincidence or a consequence of a sampling bias, as the subterranean waters in Korea were sampled quite systematically (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F28">Fig. 28</xref>). We tend to attribute to ancient lakes a role of biodiversity pumps for subterranean habitats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Karanovic and Abe 2010</xref>), in addition to their role as refugia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Matzinger et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Albrecht and Wilke 2008</xref>). Deep benthic environments in ancient lakes have very little light, and are therefore ideal for the evolution of subterranean adaptations (stygomorphies) that would enable copepods to easily colonize subterranean habitats subsequently. Korea has no ancient lakes, nor any significant natural freshwater lakes at all, and we speculate that this may be one of the main reasons for fewer subterranean species of the <italic>languidoides</italic>-group there (three) as compared with Japan (seven) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F28">Fig. 28</xref>).
            </p>
            <p>Also interesting is the fact that two species are relatively widely distributed in Korea (<italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops hanguk</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops parasuoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic>), and two also in Japan (<italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops suoensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diacyclops japonicus</tp:taxon-name></italic>), while six other species seem to be short-range endemics (sensu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Harvey 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Eberhard et al. 2009</xref>). This also indicates that the six East Asian groups, distinguished by morphological microcharacters, may have had different colonization histories there <!--PageBreak-->and are of different ages. A similar case has been observed recently in two genera of the harpacticoid family <tp:taxon-name>Parastenocarididae</tp:taxon-name> Chappuis, 1940: while the members of the genus <italic><tp:taxon-name>Proserpinicaris</tp:taxon-name></italic> Jakobi, 1972 clearly exhibit short-range endemism in Korea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Karanovic et al. 2012b</xref>), members of the genus <italic><tp:taxon-name>Parastenocaris</tp:taxon-name></italic> Kessler, 1913 seem to be more widely distributed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Karanovic and Lee 2012</xref>), although restricted to either Korea or Japan. This all suggests that the land bridges formed between Korea and Japan during the Pleistocene glacial cycles were sufficient for the dispersal of stygofauna, but the barriers that formed afterwards were sufficient to prevent significant gene flow and resulted in speciation as a rule. Our hypothesis about the isolated pockets of carbonate rocks in Korea acting as subterranean islands and harbouring short-range endemics was thus only partly supported. Renewed interest in stygofauna both in Korea and Japan will certainly result in the discovery of many endemic copepod species, and will provide further means of testing different hypothesis about the colonization history and evolution of subterranean environments.
