                <p>The <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> tiger beetle fauna on Hispaniola, the second largest island of the Greater Antilles, has more species diversity than currently recognized as all populations previously have been assigned to the insular endemic <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella dominicana</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Mandl). A comparative study of adult morphology, particularly male genitalic and female abdominal characters, for available <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> specimens from populations on Hispaniola, proposes eight additional new species also endemic to this island. Except for three sympatric species in the Sierra de Baoruco in southern Dominican Republic occurring in different habitats, all the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> on Hispaniola appear to be allopatric. Most species occur in the major mountainous regions of Hispaniola. Two species, however, are known only from river floodplains in the southern coastal plain of the Dominican Republic. <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella dominicana</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Mandl) and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella ocoa</tp:taxon-name></italic>, new species, occur along river floodplains emanating from the eastern end of the Cordillera Central in the Dominican Republic. Two new <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> species, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella bellorum</tp:taxon-name></italic>, and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella philipi</tp:taxon-name></italic>, occur in the Cordillera Central, Dominican Republic, the former species from central portions, and the latter species from north slopes of this mountain range, respectively. Three new <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> species, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella rawlinsi</tp:taxon-name></italic>, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella iviei</tp:taxon-name></italic>, and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella youngi</tp:taxon-name></italic>, are isolated in the Sierra de Baoruco, Dominican Republic, where each occupies a different habitat along an altitudinal gradient. The two new <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> species in Haiti are <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella darlingtoniana</tp:taxon-name></italic>, in the Massif de la Selle, and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella davidsoni</tp:taxon-name></italic>, in the Massif de la Hotte. All nine <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> species on Hispaniola, along with <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella viridicollis</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Dejean) and its two subspecies on Cuba, belong to the <italic>viridicollis</italic> species group of the genus <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> based on criteria presented in earlier published phylo<!--PageBreak-->genetic studies of Brazilian and West Indian tiger beetles. The subspecies <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella viridicollis fernandozayasi</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Kippenhan, Ivie and Hopp) may represent a distinct species within this species group, whereas removal of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella wickhami</tp:taxon-name></italic> (W. Horn) from this species group seems warranted based on evidence presented. A general overview of species relationships for the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> on Hispaniola are discussed, along with the current and ancestral geographic distributions of the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella viridicollis</tp:taxon-name></italic> species group in the West Indies.

            <title>Introduction</title>
            <p>A suite of synapomorphic characters, especially of the male genitalia, not found in related Western Hemisphere Cicindelinae taxa, firmly establishes the distinctiveness of the species classified as <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> Rivalier, 1954 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Rivalier 1954</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">1955</xref>). This mostly Neotropical taxonomic grouping of small (&lt;7.5 mm), primarily cursorial, tiger beetles received generic status in the latest and most comprehensive treatises of the Geadephaga of the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Lorenz 2005</xref>), and of the Western Hemisphere Carabidoidea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Erwin and Pearson 2008</xref>).
            </p>
            <p>Prior to this revision, all populations on Hispaniola had been assigned to the insular endemic <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella dominicana</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Mandl) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Freitag 1992</xref>). The author had the opportunity during the last decade to examine <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> collected by the Carnegie Museum of Natural History staff from several widely separated populations across Hispaniola, as well as, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella dominicana</tp:taxon-name></italic> type specimens. These, and other available specimens of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> collected from other parts of Hispaniola, exhibited many external differences from the holotype and paratypes of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella dominicana</tp:taxon-name></italic>. Adults differed superficially in body size and color, as well as, the extent and shape of elytral markings. This suggested that Hispaniola might possess more <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> species diversity than previously recognized.
            </p>
            <p>Consequently, the possibility of additional <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> on Hispaniola was investigated more rigorously with a comparative morphological study of available <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> specimens from populations throughout Hispaniola. Within each population, a small sample of specimens was examined to characterize and document adult external structures for both sexes when available. Male genitalic structures, particularly those within the aedeagus inner sac, and female abdominal structures, also provided useful characters for distinguishing among <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> populations on Hispaniola. Furthermore, the characteristics of these structures provided the basis for establishing the proposed concepts of the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> specieson Hispaniola. The results of these investigations are presented in this taxonomic revision.
            </p>
            <p>This taxonomic revision of the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> species on Hispaniola is organized by sections to provide: 1) taxonomic history; 2) sources of study specimens; 3) explanation of selective external adult structures, and internal male genitalic structures; 4) imaging methods for adults and male genitalia; 5) imaging methods for geographic distributions; 6) available ecological information and habitat imaging; 7) a dichotomous species key to identify adults; 8) detailed species accounts; 9) species relationships within the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella viridicollis</tp:taxon-name></italic> species group.<!--PageBreak-->
            </p>
            <p>The detailed accounts for the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> species on Hispaniola are arranged alphabetically and each includes: 1) label data from the types and other examined specimens; 2) type depositories; 3) type locality and notes on the type locality; 4) diagnostic characters for distinguishing the taxon from other taxa; 5) detailed redescription of previously known species or description of new species revealed by this revision; 6) ecological information on adult habitat and activity period, and associated tiger beetle species; 7) geographic distribution data listed and related to Hispaniola map; 8) etymology for new species; 9) remarks about comparisons with related species.
            </p>
            <p>A phylogenetic analysis of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> species on Hispaniola is beyond the scope of the present revision. However, remarks about species relationships suggested from the author's observations and experience studying the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> species on Hispaniola are presented for each species treated in this revision. A general discussion of species relationships, based on the latest published phylogenetic treatment of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic>, follows the species accounts. Emphasis is placed on the composition of the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella virdicollis</tp:taxon-name></italic> species group, as well as, its current and ancestral geographic distributions in the West Indies. Such a discussion is considered relevant for developing future studies to investigate the phylogenetic relationships of the Hispaniola <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> species treated in this revision relative to other Western Hemisphere <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic>.

            <title>Taxonomic history</title>
            <p>Philip J. Darlington, Jr., collected the first <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> specimens in small series on Hispaniola during his Museum of Comparative Zoology expeditions to Haiti in 1934 and the Dominican Republic in 1938. At least one specimen from the 1934 Haitian collection was determined by Walther Horn, the world authority among Cicindelidae taxonomists of the early 20<sup>th</sup> Century, to be the widespread Neotropical <italic><tp:taxon-name>Cicindela argentata</tp:taxon-name></italic> Fabricius 1801. It appears that the specimens from the 1938 Dominican Republic collection were not sent to Horn because catalogers only listed this species from Haiti when considering the distribution of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Cicindela argentata</tp:taxon-name></italic> Fabricius (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Blackwelder 1944</xref>) or later as <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella argentata</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Fabricius)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Erwin and Sims 1984</xref>). Indeed, even (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Rivalier (1954</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">1955</xref>), who established the generic concept of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> based on <italic><tp:taxon-name>Cicindela argentata</tp:taxon-name></italic> Fabricius as its type species, did not alter this view about more than one species on Hispaniola.
            </p>
            <p>The prevailing view about the Hispaniolan <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> changed, however, when Karl Mandl described <italic><tp:taxon-name>Cicindela (Brasiella) dominicana</tp:taxon-name></italic> 1983 based on specimens collected in 1971 by J. Klapperich (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Mandl 1983</xref>). Comparative study of a paratypic male specimen of this new species, with those Darlington had collected earlier, led <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Freitag (1992)</xref> to conclude that all the Hispaniola specimens he examined represented one insular endemic species, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Cicindela (Brasiella) dominicana</tp:taxon-name></italic> Mandl.
            </p>
            <p>Since that publication, the author of this revision has had the opportunity to examine large numbers of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> specimens collected at several localities on Hispaniola from 1988 to 2008. Specimens were collected as follows: large series at sites in Peder<!--PageBreak-->nales Province, Dominican Republic by Michael A. Ivie, WIBP; several large series at sites in Pedernales and La Vega Provinces in the Dominican Republic and Département du l'Sud, Haiti, by John E. Rawlins and Robert L. Davidson, CMNH; a small series from Santiago Province, Dominican Republic, by Brian Farrell, MCZH; small series from Peravia and La Vega Provinces, Dominican Republic, by David Brzoska. All of Darlington's <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> specimens deposited at MCZH and at NMNH were also examined. Paratypes of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella dominicana</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Mandl) at CMNH were examined, and the holotype and other paratypes of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella dominicana</tp:taxon-name></italic> were borrowed from NHMW.

                <p>This taxonomic revision was fostered by the availability of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> specimens, including the holotype and paratypes of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella dominicana</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Mandl), from the various museums and private collections listed below under Specimen Depositories.

                <title>Comparative Morphology</title>
                <p>Obvious external morphological differences exhibited by specimens from different populations were utilized as the initial basis for species recognition. However, the decision about the distinctiveness of each species ultimately involved internal characters of the male genitalia, particularly the aedeagus inner sac or intromittent organ. Female external abdominal characters were utilized secondarily to support the decisions provided by the male genitalia.</p>
            </sec>
            <sec sec-type="External Structures">
                <title>External Structures</title>
                <p>The external structures presented below under Systematics for the key couplets to identify the species, and in their individual Species Accounts, are based on recognition of selected sclerites and appendages common to all Coleoptera. Most statements that characterize these external structures are obvious and apparent to those familiar with the study of tiger beetles; however, certain external structures typical of tiger beetles in general, and of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> in particular, require clarification and explanation as applied specifically to this revision.
                </p>
                <p><italic>Body Size</italic>. In the descriptions that accompany each species, a range in body size within that species, from the largest to the smallest specimens available for study, is shown for comparison among species. Body size is presented to the nearest 0.1 mm for body length, measured dorsally from the frons of the head to the posterior tip of the elytra, and elytra width, measured dorsally across the anterior humeral angles of the elytra through the middle of the scutellum. Body length measurements reflect the position of the body when the hypognathus head is in the normal feeding position and the labrum is nearly vertical. Elytra width measurements were obtained at the most stable position on the elytra although the body is widest at the outer apical angle of the elytra. However, because the elytral suture often becomes widely separated at the apex in dried specimens, width measurements across that part of the elytra would be erroneously larger. Body size measurements were obtained with an ocular micrometer calibrated at 10 X magnification.
                </p>
                <p><italic>Labrum Dimensions</italic>. The labrum is a conspicuous structure in tiger beetles and has been characterized in the descriptions for most species published in the taxonomic literature for this group. For comparison of this structure among the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> described in this revision, the dimensions of the labrum are presented as a width to length ratio for the holotype male, and a similar ratio for the known allotype female, of each species. Labral width is the transverse dimension, whereas, labral length is the longitudinal one along the body axis. The measurements of width and length were taken on the longest dimensions of the labrum.
                </p>
                <p><italic>Eye Size</italic>. The eye size of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> species on Hispaniola is presented in this revision as a means for not only distinguishing between the sexes of certain species, but also between some of the species themselves. Undoubtedly, eye size provides a species <!--PageBreak-->specific means to acquire visual cues for mating and prey selection, as well as predator avoidance, under the prevailing light conditions within the habitat used by each particular species. Most diurnal tiger beetle species have relatively large eyes to acquire these visual cues. However, their eyes may be “prominent” in the dorsal dimension or “bulging” in the lateral dimension or have characteristics of both conditions.
                </p>
                <p>The first of the two conditions of eye size used in this revision is based on the proportion of the eye surfaces dorsally above the vertex of the head. View a specimen anteriorly such that the top of the vertex between the eyes is nearly parallel to the line of sight of the viewer and the point of insertion of the posterior supraorbital setae is just visible at the eye top. Eyes are considered “prominent” if a majority of the eye surface extends above a line drawn across the inner anterior angle of each eye just below the point of insertion of the anterior supraorbital setae. The second condition of eye size is based on the proportion of the eye surfaces laterally beyond the vertex of the head. View a specimen dorsally and assess the degree of curvature of the outline of the eyes. Eyes are considered “bulging” if the eye surface occupies a larger arc area than that occupied by the vertex as defined by arc length of the curved eye boundary. For the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> species on Hispaniola, prominent eyes are the normal condition exhibited by most species, whereas bulging eyes exist only for a few species.

                <p><italic>Coupling Sulcus</italic>. The coupling sulcus is a depression, groove, pit or cavity, or a combination of these, on the female mesepisterna that receives the male mandibles during copulation. This structure was described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Freitag (1974)</xref> as an important secondary sexual mechanism for mate selection within a species. Because the characteristics of the coupling sulcus are distinctive and fairly consistent on females within a species, it can be used to differentiate closely related species and provides an additional aid to species identification. The coupling sulcus (CS) has been indicated on the anterior lateral images of adult females presented in the figures accompanying this revision for all species except one whose female is unknown.
                </p>
                <p><italic>Abdominal Structures</italic>. Some females of the genus <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> possess abdominal structures visible on the exposed ventral surfaces of the terminal sterna that are unique within Western Hemisphere Cicindelinae. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Freitag and Barnes (1989)</xref> first noted one of these unusual abdominal characters, which they termed an “unpigmented, bell-shaped spot”, on the female 5<sup>th</sup> sternum medially along its posterior margin. The color of the integument in Cicindelinae, however, is not derived from pigmentation, but rather, interference reflection of light from different epicuticular layers formed during sclerotization of the integument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Schultz and Rankin 1985a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">1985b</xref>). So rather than being unpigmented, this structure is actually membranous, unsclerotized cuticle. This transverse band on the female 5<sup>th</sup> sternum in this revision is referred to as a membranous wedge (MW). Anterior to this membranous wedge on the same sternum lies a second structure, a membranous longitudinal median band (MB). Both membranous structures are developed to various degrees in most <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> species on Hispaniola for which the female is known. Transverse wrinkles in the integument also are pr<!--PageBreak-->esent medially on the female 6<sup>th</sup> sternum of certain <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> species on Hispaniola. In addition, a small mediolateral gibbosity (LG) situated on each side of the female 6<sup>th</sup> sternum is present in all <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> species on Hispaniola for which the female is known. These structures on the female 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> sternum are labelled on the images presented in the figures accompanying this revision for all species except one whose female is unknown.

                <title>Internal Structures</title>
                <p>Male genitalia are the only internal structures discussed in this revision. Within the key couplets to species identification, and in the individual species accounts, selected sclerites very specific to <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> are referenced. Knowledge of these sclerites requires an explanation of each to understand their characteristics and help ensure their recognition. In addition to the shape and size of each sclerite, its arrangement relative to other sclerites within the aedeagus inner sac is important for comparison among species. Application of this knowledge to species identification requires careful dissection of male specimens and preparation of their genitalia to maintain the arrangement of the aedeagus inner sac sclerites.
                </p>
                <p>The orientation of the male genitalia and aedeagus inner sac, as presented in this revision, is referenced based on the genitalia positioning within the abdomen. Male genitalia are normally found in this location when specimens are killed during collecting and later pinned or point-mounted for study. For an interpretation of these structures during mating, refer to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Freitag et al. (1985)</xref> and the detailed explanation in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Acciavatti and Pearson (1989)</xref>.

                <p><italic>Male Genitalia</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Rivalier (1954</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">1955</xref>) characterized the genus <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> and distinguished species he studied based on distinctive differences exhibited by structures of the male genitalia. Ultimate decisions regarding distinctiveness of species in the present revision are based on the form of the male genitalia, especially the hooked tip at the aedeagus apex, and the degree of differentiation of the four internal sclerites and associated spine fields within the male aedeagus inner sac. These sclerites and spine fields are defined below, and have been indicated by their codes on images of the male aedeagus inner sac presented for all species in the figures accompanying this revision.
                </p>
                <p>The four distinctive sclerites within the inner sac of the aedeagus that characterize <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> were named and defined by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Rivalier (1954</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">1955</xref>). Rivalier's name for each of these structures has been translated here into English with his original French terminology shown in brackets. Each sclerite within the aedeagus inner sac is defined along with information about the range of its variation evident in Hispaniola <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> species, and its location relative to other inner sac sclerites and the genitalia itself. The code assigned here to each sclerite, and other associated structures, are shown in the images for the holotype male of each species as presented in the figures:
                </p>
                <p><!--PageBreak-->Arched piece [<italic>la</italic> <italic>pièce arciforme</italic>] (AP): narrow, obliquely oriented and long to broad, obliquely oriented and short; thinnest sclerite; densely sclerotized along entire length; lies dorsally across other sclerites; not visible externally.
                </p>
                <p>Shield [<italic>un bouclier</italic>] (SH): distinct, single apex with rounded tip to distinct, single apex with tapering tip; smallest sclerite; not densely sclerotized; occupies lower end of genital opening; entire distal end distinctly visible externally.
                </p>
                <p>Large tooth [<italic>la grande dent</italic>] (LT): elongate with a pointed apex to broad with a rounded apex; most bulky sclerite; densely sclerotized except at distal end; extended basally into a densely sclerotized root; not visible externally.
                </p>
                <p>Stylet [<italic>le stylet</italic>] (ST): long, broad and straight with pointed tip to long, broad and bent with recurved or hooked tip; longest sclerite; not densely sclerotized; occupies upper end of genital opening; tip visible externally.
                </p>
                <p>Additional structures within the inner sac were characterized as follows:</p>
                <p>Spine Fields (SF): several patches of sclerotized setae of various sizes and shapes, the one within the aedeagus neck being the one most obvious and diagnostic; others are positioned inside the genital opening on either side of it.</p>
                <p>Dark Fields (DF): darkened, membranous areas near Root of Large Tooth.</p>
                <p>Root (RT): densely sclerotized, curved and forked, basal extension of Large Tooth.</p>
                <p><italic>Male Genitalia Preparation</italic>. A few adult males, representative of the different populations of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> available from Hispaniola, were each prepared for removal of the genitalia by soaking the entire specimen in a weak solution of ammonia for a day or two. The aedeagus could then be easily pulled out or removed from each relaxed abdomen, and through gentle squeezing with fine forceps, the four sclerites and associated setal brushes within its inner sac could be extruded for examination and imaging. For future reference as vouchers, the aedeagus of each sampled specimen has been stored in glycerin in a microvial and this pinned underneath the specimen. These specimens have been deposited with the museum or in the collections shown above under the Specimen Depositories utilized for this revision.

Standard fiber optics lights were used to illuminate all specimens imaged with the light diffused by white translucent surfaces.<!--PageBreak--></p>
                <p>Male genitalic and aedeagal images were obtained using a Nikon CoolPix L5, 7.2 megapixel, 5 X zoom, digital camera through a Bausch and Lomb zoom stereomicroscope. To facilitate imaging of the male genitalia and the aedeagus with its extruded inner sac sclerites, these structures were placed in glycerin within the well of a glass slide. The glass slide was suspended above neutral gray photographic paper. Thus suspended, the aedeagus was illuminated by two fiber optics lights adjusted from various angles to provide both back lighting and minimize glare.</p>
                <p>All images were cropped and photo enhanced with standard photo editor software on a personal computer.

                    <title>Ecology.</title>
                    <p>This species occurs on the clay slopes of road cuts and adjacent dirt roads within dense secondary evergreen and broadleaf forests with pines on slopes in the central parts of the Cordillera Central between 915 to 1730 m elevations. At the type locality, adults and larvae of this species were present and abundant in May when Robert L. Davidson collected the large type series (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F18">Figs 18B-18D</xref>). The two adults taken the previous November at the type locality may not truly represent how abundant this species can be at that time year when less avid collectors visited the type locality. However, this species may actually be less abundant in November than earlier in May. Indeed, David W. Brzoska, who is an accomplished tiger beetle collector, was only able<!--PageBreak--> to collect 11 specimens of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella bellorum</tp:taxon-name></italic> in November at a locality at 1538 m only about 5 km away from the type locality. The specimens he collected were found near wet areas around puddles on exposed red clay along a grassy dirt road. Thus, adult activity for <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella bellorum</tp:taxon-name></italic> spans seven months with adults more abundant in May than later in August and November.

                    <p><italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella bellorum</tp:taxon-name></italic>, new species, and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella philipi</tp:taxon-name></italic>, new species, both occur in the Cordillera Central, Dominican Republic, the former species in the central areas and the latter species on the northern slopes of this mountain range. The elytral pattern of both species are very similar and only differ in the form of the elytral lunules; narrowed and broken in <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella bellorum</tp:taxon-name></italic>, but wide and more developed in <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella philipi</tp:taxon-name></italic>, especially in the shape of the hook at the discal end of the middle band. Despite this superficial similarity, there seems little doubt that these two species are distinctive based on differences in the form of the sclerites within the aedeagus of males for each species. A comparison of the other morphological characters presented in the key and the descriptions for each species further support their distinctiveness. The geographic range of both these species, although apparently allopatric based on the limited collection data currently available, may be found to coincide more with additional collecting in the Cordillera Central. Despite their distinctiveness as separate species and apparent allopatry, it is interesting to note that these two species seem to occupy a similar habitat type in these mountains with adults of both species active during the same summer months. Their geographic distributions in close proximity to each other in similar high elevation habitats suggest a common lineage.

The type locality, herein established at the above coordinates, was implied from the type labels because the actual location where Darlington collected this new species is uncertain; his label data only generalized his collecting along the route he took during his expedition to Haiti. La Visite is a National Park, Parc de La Visite, located along Highway 101 in a relatively flat, high elevation area along this highway at 6000 feet in the Massif de la Selle south of Port-au-Prince, Haiti. However, Darlington almost certainly did not collect this new species within La Visite National Park based on the discussion presented below under Ecology. In consideration of that information, the type locality for this species is more precisely established above using Google Earth©. The type locality was chosen to be a site adjoining La Visite slightly to the north (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F18">Fig. 18F</xref>) with the coordinates shown above.

                    <p>The exact locality, and hence the habitat, where Darlington collected this new species is uncertain. Darlington's labels on his 1934-collecting trip to the Massif de la Selle indicate that he first collected south of Port-au-Prince from “Kenskoff [Kenscoff] to La Visite and vicinity” and then later on his return trip along an “auto road” from Furcy to Kenskoff [Kenscoff]. The auto road he took is most likely the same as current Highway 101 that traverses the Massif de la Selle from Port-au-Prince to near the southern coast of Haiti. Suitable habitats where Darlington collected likely occurred along this road at elevations of roughly 5000 feet. An image from Google Earth© (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F18">Fig. 18E</xref>), and a geotagged image from http://flickr.com taken in early 2010 along Highway 101 below its summit in the vicinity of Parc de La Visite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F18">Fig. 18F</xref>), both show an unimproved rocky road cut into a steep slope with sparse vegetation. The road banks and roadway appear eroded and traversed mostly on foot by local inhabitants. In Parc de La Visite itself, this highway reaches 6000 feet elevations, becomes much more level, and runs through stands of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Pinus occidentalis</tp:taxon-name></italic> Swartz with grassy openings of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Andropogon</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. within the pine forest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F18">Fig. 18E</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Darlington (1935)</xref> notes that his base camp for collecting at La Visite was in “tall pine forest at 6,000 feet beside the Rivière Chotard” [currently known as Cascade de Seguin]. However, he states that his collecting within the pine stands produced no carabids. Thus, the habitat where Darlington collected this new species is likely situated along the road he took to reach Parc de La Visite, but at a lower elevation than where he camped. The site in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F18">Fig. 18F</xref> with eroded clay banks along Highway 101 at about 1755 m (5760 ft) has been selected as the type locality for this new species. The only known specimens of this new species were collected during September.

Kenskoff [Kenscoff], Furcy, and La Visite are localities on the labels of the type specimens collected by P.J. Darlington in 1934. This species likely occurs in suitable habitats from Kenscoff to the northwestern boundary of Parc de La Visite along Highway 101. This highway from Furcy southward to La Visite traverses a series of long ridges at about 5000 feet elevation before rising abruptly to 6000 feet where it crosses over to the southern slopes of the Massif de la Selle.

                    <p>This Latinized eponym, genitive case, is based on the family name of the late Philip J. Darlington, Museum of Comparative Zoology, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts. The species name acknowledges his contributions as the preeminent American carabidologist during the Mid-20th Century. During his 1934 expedition to Haiti, Darlington was the first coleopterist to collect in the Massif de la Selle, the highest mountains in Haiti. Darlington collected the types of this new species along the autoroute taken by his expedition across the Massif de la Selle in the vicinity of La Visite, now designated as Parc de La Visite, a National Park in this southeastern Haitian mountain range.</p>

                    <title>Remarks.</title>
                    <p>This species is most closely related to <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella davidsoni</tp:taxon-name></italic> from the Massif de la Hotte on the Tiburon Peninsula of western Haiti ca. 185 km to the west of the Massif de la Selle. The four typical sclerites within the inner sac of the aedeagus that characterize <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> are very similar for both species especially the unusual form of the recurved terminal tip of the stylet, although this differs in the degree of its curvature for each species. Females of both species possess similar small, paired mediolateral gibbosities on the 6th abdominal sternum. Moreover, the elytral markings of both species are quite similar in pattern with only the extremities of the humeral lunule evident; this marking on all specimens examined consistently was divided into a humeral mark and a discal spot variously reduced or enlarged depending on the specimen. Additionally, the middle lunule always terminates near the suture in a broad hook never anteriorly recurved. However, the distinctiveness of these two species is confirmed by differences between the two in the size of the recurved aedeagus apex of males, as well as, differences in the extent of development of the membranous longitudinal median band and membranous wedge on the 5th abdominal sternum of females.

                    <p>Robert L. Davidson informed the author that this new species, named in his honor, was extremely abundant at the type locality when he and other CMNH staff collected there in early September. This new species was collected along dirt roads and trails through fields and disturbed forests at 1405 m on the south slope of Morne Formon in the Massif de la Hotte (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F19">Fig. 19A</xref>). Darlington's specimen labels indicate he collected this new species at about the same elevation around the paratype locality of Desbarriere in mid-October. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Darlington (1935)</xref> during his Haitian Expedition traversed treacherous terrain at Desbarriere where vegetation covered eroded limestone slopes on the north side of the Massif de la Hotte. From the collection data available, it appears that adults of this new species are active during the latter part of the year in September and October.

                    <title>Etymology.</title>
                    <p>This Latinized eponym, genitive case, is based on the family name of Robert L. Davidson, Carnegie Museum of Natural History, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Robert is a recognized taxonomic expert on Carabidae and, for several decades, has been my mentor for studying these beetles and a close friend. I am honored to name this species for him, not only because he collected this new species, but also for his outstanding efforts to acquire specimens of several other new <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> species described in this revision. Although Philip J. Darlington collected specimens of this new species in the Massif de la Hotte during his 1934 expedition to Haiti, earlier workers did not consider these to be distinct from either <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella argentata</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Fabricius) or <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella dominicana</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Mandl). The conspecificity of the Darlington specimens with <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella davidsoni</tp:taxon-name></italic> was established in this revision. The Darlington specimens fall within the range of variation exhibited by this new species as documented by the large series of specimens collected by Robert L. Davidson and CMNH colleagues.

                    <title>Remarks.</title>
                    <p>This species appears closely related to <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella darlingtoniana</tp:taxon-name></italic> from the Massif de la Selle situated farther eastward in central Haiti (refer to discussion under that species) because of the suite of unique synapomorhic characters the two share that are not found in other <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> on Hispaniola. The shape and form of the male aedeagus and the four typical sclerites within the inner sac of the aedeagus that characterize <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> are the most highly modified in this species compared to others on Hispaniola. Among these modifications, the aedeagus neck is broadly and distinctly recurved with an apex terminating in an extremely short, blunt end. Furthermore, the inner sac of the male genitalia has a stylet with a distinctively hooked terminal tip. For females, the membranous transverse wedge and longitudinal median band on the 5th abdominal sternum, fully or partially developed in the other <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> species on<!--PageBreak--> Hispaniola, are completely absent. These modified morphological characters of this species, unique among the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> on Hispaniola, were not previously considered in earlier phylogenetic analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Freitag and Barnes 1989</xref>). Because of this omission, it is unclear how to interpret their conclusions about phylogeny within the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella viridicollis</tp:taxon-name></italic> Dejean species group, a concept now greatly expanded by the addition of numerous species described in this revision. Thus, the relationship of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella davidsoni</tp:taxon-name></italic> to the other <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> in the Dominican Republic remains uncertain. Loss or modification of several characters by <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella davidsoni</tp:taxon-name></italic> of homologous characters found in related species implies isolation for a long period of time leading to these character divergences.

Bani is a town situated on the coastal plain where the Cordillera Central terminate along the southcentral coast of the Dominican Republic. Exactly where the type series for this species originated previously has been uncertain as Mandl did not present a specific locality other than Bani nor have any other specimens of this species been collected subsequent to the original type series. However, refer to the discussion under its Ecology below for circumstantial evidence as to the most likely collection site to help establish the type locality for this species at the coordinates shown above.</p>

                    <p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Mandl (1983)</xref> was not specific about the exact site where this species was collected, its habitat is uncertain. Nonetheless, the habitat of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella dominicana</tp:taxon-name></italic> can be inferred from its association with another tiger beetle, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Cicindela (Plectographa) schaefferi</tp:taxon-name></italic> W. Horn 1903. Both species were collected by Klapperich on the same dates at Bani based on the information presented in Mandl's publication and specimens examined at CMNH. <italic><tp:taxon-name>Cicindela schaefferi</tp:taxon-name></italic> occurs at other locations in the Dominican Republic at low elevations in riparian habitats based on specimens collected by Robert L. Davidson deposited at CMNH. Thus, it would appear that <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella dominicana</tp:taxon-name></italic> also occurs in riparian habitats at low elevations, such as along the Rio Bani. This river originates in the southern end of the Cordillera Central and emerges from these mountains and flows along the eastern edge of Bani where Highway 2 crosses the Rio Bani (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F19">Fig. 19B</xref>). Additional inference about the collection site for <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella dominicana</tp:taxon-name></italic> can be made from the better substantiated collection data for <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella ocoa</tp:taxon-name></italic>, new species, which actually originated from a low elevation site along the southern coast of the Dominican Republic also in association with <italic><tp:taxon-name>Cicindela schaefferi</tp:taxon-name></italic> (refer to Ecology under that species account). These low elevation coastal plain habitats appear to be unusual for <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> species on Hispaniola based on ecological information provided by CMNH entomologist Robert L. Davidson. Davidson, who collected several of the new species of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> described in this revision, reported encountering their adults only in the mountainous regions of Hispaniola. Because <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella dominicana</tp:taxon-name></italic> occurs in low elevation habitats, it would appear that <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> species on Hispaniola actually occupy a wider habitat range than previously thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Erwin and Pearson 2008</xref>). Adults of the type series of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella dominicana</tp:taxon-name></italic> were collected in August and September indicating an adult activity period during the later summer months.

                    <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F22">Fig. 22</xref>. DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: Peravia Province, Bani vicinity along Rio Bani. The town of Bani lies in the coastal plain on the southcentral coast of the Dominican Republic. The Rio Bani emerges from the southeastern end of Cordillera Central and flows along the eastern edge of the town. This species likely occurs elsewhere along the Rio Bani further southward toward the coast and northward into the Cordillera Central.

                    <p><italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella dominicana</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Mandl) and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella ocoa</tp:taxon-name></italic>, new species, are the only species on Hispaniola with an elytral pattern of shiny, white markings with all lunules wide, complete and boldly contrasting with the darker, background color in most specimens examined. Despite this superficial similarity, there seems little doubt that these two species are distinctive based on differences in the form of the sclerites within the aedeagus of males of each species. A comparison of the other morphological characters presented in the key and the descriptions for each species further support their distinctiveness. These two species also appear to be allopatric based on the limited collection data currently available. However, additional collecting may change our understanding of their allopatry. Despite this distinctiveness as separate species and apparent allopatry, it is interesting to note that these two species seem to occupy a similar habitat type along the flood plains of major rivers flowing from the southeastern end of the Cordillera Central in Peravia Province, Dominican Republic. In these flood plain <!--PageBreak-->habitats, both species appear to have developed different habitat requirements from other species on Hispaniola. Their limited geographic distributions in close proximity to each other, and their similar requirements for low elevation habitats, may be the result of a common lineage.

However, Las Abejas is a locality often visited by entomological expeditions to the Sierra de Baoruco, the mountains in the eastern area of the southernmost part of the Dominican Republic. The type locality is established here with coordinates shown above based on data published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Woodruff (2004)</xref> for Scarabaeidae specimens collected at Las Abejas by Robert L. Davidson and John E. Rawlins on their 1987 CMNH expedition to the Sierra de Baoruco, Dominican Republic. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F20">Fig. 20A</xref> depicts the ravines typically found at upper elevations on the southern slope of the Sierra de Baoruco; Las Abejas being one of the ravines accessible by a footpath from higher elevations (refer to Ecology below).

                    <p>The type series was collected at 1250 m within Las Abejas, a deep ravine abruptly descending from the forests of Hispaniolan Pine, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Pinus occidentalis</tp:taxon-name></italic> Swartz 1788, that cover the higher elevations on the southern slopes of the Sierra de Baoruco (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Konstantinov and Chamorro-Lacayo 2006</xref>). The habitat at Las Abejas has a premon<!--PageBreak-->tane, wet forest, rich in epiphytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Fisher-Meerow and Judd 2008</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F20">Fig. 20A</xref>, these moist forests occur in ravines at upper elevations along the southern slopes of the Sierra de Baoruco. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F20">Fig. 20B</xref> depicts the highly erosive nature of the clay soils on these slopes, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F20">Fig. 20C</xref> depicts the diverse nature of the vegetation along the footpath descending into the higher parts of Las Abejas. In these habitats, the adults of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella iviei</tp:taxon-name></italic> would appear to be rarely seen, and if they were seen, then to readily escape hand collecting by running into the vegetation. Indeed, nearly all the known adult specimens of this new species were collected with flight intercept or malaise traps. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F20">Fig. 20D</xref> shows a tropical malaise trap set up in an opening along a trail within the forest at Las Abejas during the 1987 CMNH expedition to the Sierra de Baoruco, Dominican Republic. Based on the type series of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella iviei</tp:taxon-name></italic> collected in August and September, this new species likely has its period of adult activity during the later summer months.

                    <p>This Latinized eponym, genitive case, is based on the family name of Michael A. Ivie, Department of Entomology, Montana State University, Bozeman, Montana. Ivie collected the first series of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> specimens in 1988 from the Sierra de Baoruco, Pedernales Province, Dominican Republic, as part of his West Indian Beetle Fauna Project (WIBP). He previously considered these specimens to be only variants of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella dominicana</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Mandl). I am grateful for the opportunity he has provided for me to examine these WIBP specimens because it has led to the discovery of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella iviei</tp:taxon-name></italic>,and other related new species in the Sierra de Baoruco, an area in the Dominican Republic known for its high endemism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Woodruff 2004</xref>).

                    <p><italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella iviei</tp:taxon-name></italic> appears to be most closely related to <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella rawlinsi</tp:taxon-name></italic>. However, their distinctiveness as separate species was established in this revision by differences presented in the key to their identification and under their descriptions. Adults of the former species are larger in body size with a proportionately longer head and pronotum than any known individuals of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella rawlinsi</tp:taxon-name></italic> in the Sierra de Baoruco. Also, elytral markings of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella iviei</tp:taxon-name></italic>, although still faint compared to other species on Hispaniola, are more obvious and wider than the majority of known <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella rawlinsi</tp:taxon-name></italic> specimens. Males of these two species possess distinctive aedeagus inner sac sclerites, in particular, the form of the stylet. Additional differences between females of these two species are evident in the extent to which the membranous, longitudinal median band is developed on the 5th abdominal sternum, the size of the lateral gibbosities on the 6th abdominal sternum, along with the breadth and depth of the median notch on the 8<sup>th</sup> abdominal sternum. In addition to these morphological differences between <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella iviei</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella rawlinsi</tp:taxon-name></italic>, each species occurs in a markedly different habitat, despite their adjacent locations in the Sierra de Baoruco. As presented under Ecology for each species, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella iviei</tp:taxon-name></italic> is found in moist habitats of mixed deciduous forests, whereas <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella rawlinsi</tp:taxon-name></italic> occurs in drier grassland habitats within pine forests.<!--PageBreak-->

However, their distinctiveness as separate species has been established by differences in the sclerites within the adult male aedeagus and other characters presented in the key and under their descriptions. Nonetheless, that fact that both species appear to have similar habitat requirements in low elevation flood plains, in contrast to the high elevation montane habitat requirements of most other <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> species known from Hispaniola, suggests that they may share a common lineage.

                    <p>This Latinized eponym, genitive case, is based on the first name of the late Philip J. Darlington, Museum of Comparative Zoology, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts. Darlington was the distinguished American carabidologist who pioneered studies of Carabidae island biogeography in the Mid-20th Century. The first specimens of this new species were collected by Darlington during his 1938 expedition to the Dominican Republic. Brian Farrell, also from MCZH, in 2008 collected additional specimens with more precise locality data, while retracing the route of Darlington's expedition 50 years earlier.</p>

                    <p>Both <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella philipi</tp:taxon-name></italic>, new species, and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella bellorum</tp:taxon-name></italic>, new species, are allopatric in the Cordillera Central, Dominican Republic, the former species on the northern slopes and the latter species in the mountainous central areas. The elytral pattern of both species is very similar and only differs in the form of the elytral lunules. <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella philipi</tp:taxon-name></italic> possesses more fully developed and wider lunules of nearly uniform width, whereas the lunules of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella bellorum</tp:taxon-name></italic> are narrow and broken. These lunule differences are most obvious in the shape of the hook at the discal end of the middle band. Although the elytral patterns are similar, the distinctiveness of each species is established by differences in their genitalia, especially the form of the sclerites and spine fields within the aedeagus of the males. A comparison of the other morphological characters presented in the key and the descriptions for each species further support their distinctiveness. Although these two species are apparently allopatric based on available collection data, more collecting in the Cordillera Central will help confirm their allopatry. Despite their distinctiveness as separate species and apparent allopatry, it should be noted that these two species are found in similar mountain habitats with adults of both species active during the same summer months. Their geographic distributions in close proximity to each other in similar high elevation habitats suggest a common lineage.

                    <p>It is likely that the actual type locality lies at a slightly higher elevation than provided in this revision. CMNH entomologists visited this type locality again in June 2003, two years after the type series was collected (J.E. Rawlins, R.L. Davidson, 2010, personal communications). At that time, perhaps with improved GPS devices, the following coordinates and elevation were obtained with more precision: <named-content content-type="dwc:verbatimCoordinates" xlink:type="simple">18°09'23&quot;N, 71°34'09&quot;W</named-content> at a slightly higher elevation of 1560 m. These coordinates and the elevation are based on data published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Woodruff (2004)</xref> for Scarabaeidae specimens collected at Aceitillar by Robert L. Davidson and John E. Rawlins on the 1987, 1991 and 2003 CMNH expeditions to this locality in the Sierra de Baoruco, Dominican Republic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F20">Figs 20E, 20F</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Woodruff (2004)</xref>, the locality known as Aceitillar is based on a common <italic><tp:taxon-name>Andropogon</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp.grass that grows there in assocation with <italic><tp:taxon-name>Pinus occidentalis</tp:taxon-name></italic> Swartz; this grass is known locally as aceitillo; aceitillar being the place where the aceitillo grows. Indeed, Accitillar [Aceitillar] was printed on labels for certain paratypes of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella rawlinsi</tp:taxon-name></italic> originating with WIBP, and later Aceitillar appeared on labels from the June 2003 CMNH expedition to the Sierra de Baoruco.

                    <p>This new species is found in the Dominican Republic across a range of higher elevations in the Sierra de Baoruco from 1250 to 1560 m. Its habitats are dominated by Hispaniolan pine, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Pinus occidentalis</tp:taxon-name></italic> Swartz, and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Andropogon</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. grasses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F20">Figs 20E, 20F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F21">21A, 21B</xref>). The red clay soil types prevalent in these habitats are derived from bauxite deposits that are surface mined and reclaimed extensively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F21">Fig. 21A</xref>) in this part of the Sierra de Baoruco (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Woodruff 2004</xref>). Adults have been collected in disturbed sites along dirt roads and trails during August and September. These adults were abundant along an infrequently traveled road where Robert L. Davidson collected the type series during the 1991 CMNH expedition to the Dominican Republic. This type locality is in the vicinity of the campsite used by the several CMNH expeditions to this locality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F20">Fig. 20E</xref>). Adults were also abundant at several other sites at slightly lower elevations in 1988 based on WIBP collection data. It should be noted that CMNH entomologists have visited the type locality at other times of the year, July 1987 and June 2003, but no specimens of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella rawlinsi</tp:taxon-name></italic> were seen (R.L. Davidson, 2010, personal communication). Thus, adult activity for this new species appears restricted to a distinctive period during the late summer. In addition to hand collecting adults both running and flying, this new species has been taken in malaise and intercept traps. <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella rawlinsi</tp:taxon-name></italic> occurs sympatrically with <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella iviei</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella youngi</tp:taxon-name></italic> in the Sierra de Baoruco, but in different habitats; the former species occurs in drier pine and grass woodlands, whereas the latter two species occur in mixed deciduous forests on the southern slopes of these mountains. Refer to the discussions under Ecology for <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella iviei</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella youngi</tp:taxon-name></italic> to obtain more details about their habitats.

                    <p>This Latinized eponym, genitive case, is based on the family name of John E. Rawlins, Curator of Invertebrate Zoology, Carnegie Museum of Natural History, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The species name honors John for his encouragement and the assistance he provided to move this revision toward its completion. He also has been a colleague and friend for several decades while the author has been associated with the CMNH. Dr. Rawlins organized the several expeditions to inventory the insect fauna of Hispaniola that resulted in the collections of several of the new <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> species described in this revision.

                    <p>The distinctiveness of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella rawlinsi</tp:taxon-name></italic> from the closely related <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella iviei</tp:taxon-name></italic> was established in this revision by differences presented in the key to their identification and under their descriptions. Other than the more obvious differences in smaller body size and proportionately shorter head and pronotum of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella rawlinsi</tp:taxon-name></italic> compared with <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella iviei</tp:taxon-name></italic>, important distinctions exist between the male aedeagus of these two species. Both species differ in the shape of the apical hook, as well as, the form of the sclerites of the inner sac, especially the thickness and degree of curvature in the sty<!--PageBreak-->let apex. Additional differences between females of these two species are evident in the extent to which the membranous, longitudinal median band is developed on the 5<sup>th</sup> abdominal sternum. Previously, M. Ivie (WIBP) and T.K. Philips (WKSU), who collected specimens of both these new species in the Sierra de Baoruco in 1988, initially thought the populations in these mountains might represent a new species; however, their unpublished study considered them only <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella dominicana</tp:taxon-name></italic> variants (Philips 1994, personal communication).

No coordinates are on the holotype labels; however, an approximation of the coordinates shown above was obtained by measuring 13.5 km to 140 m along the only road north of Cabo Rojo using Google Earth©. Deciduous woodlands adjoining desert scrub typically are found at this elevation on the lower southern slopes of the Sierra de Baoruco (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F21">Figs 21E, 21F</xref>). The allotype was collected at a site called Haitian Hut on the CMNH 1991 expedition (J.E. Rawlins, 2010, personal communication). The site was given this name because of the Haitian squatters who have gained easy access to the lower southern slopes of the Sierra de Baoruco by using the highway built by Alcoa, Inc., to reach bauxite mines higher in the Sierra de Baoruco (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Woodruff 2004</xref>).

                    <p>The unique holotype male was collected at 130 m in a flight intercept trap in deciduous forest, whereas the unique allotype female specimen was collected in wet, deciduous forest at 730 m. Deciduous forest typical of the lower slopes is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F20">Fig. 20F</xref>, whereas deciduous forest typical of the middle slopes is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F20">Fig. 20D</xref>. Although the collection method for the allotype was not specified on its labels, a passive method of either malaise or yellow pan traps were both employed by CMNH staff while collecting at a site for several days. Both specimens were found on the lower south slopes of the Sierra de Baoruco in September. Vegetation in this part of the Sierra de Baoruco gradually transitions from desert-like habitats below 255 m through dry deciduous forest at 255 m to moist tropical forest and eventually grass and pine habitat at higher elevations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Woodruff 2004</xref>). Because of this great diversity of habitats, these mountains at the eastern end of the southernmost part of the Dominican Republic have high floristic and faunal endemism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Woodruff 2004</xref>).

Obvious morphological differences between the two species are exhibited by the size of their eyes and the extent to which the pale elytral pattern is infuscated by the darker ground color. Other important distinctions exist between females of these two species in the depth and position of the female coupling sulcus, the extent to which the membranous, longitudinal median band is developed on the 5th abdominal sternum and the form of the emargination on the 8th sternum. Although both species occur in the Sierra de Baoruco at the same time of year, each species occurs at a different elevation in quite different habitats (refer to Ecology for each of these species). <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella youngi</tp:taxon-name></italic> is less closely related to <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella iviei</tp:taxon-name></italic> based on their male genitalia; although both of these species apparently occur in more moist habitats than <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella rawlinsi</tp:taxon-name></italic>.

                        <p>Although a phylogenetic analysis of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> species on Hispaniola is not part of the present revision, a general discussion of the latest published phylogenetic treatment of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> relative to the Hispaniola species, is considered relevant. Emphasis is placed on the composition of the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella virdicollis</tp:taxon-name></italic> species group, along with its current and ancestral geographic distributions in the West Indies. Such a discussion is considered relevant for suggesting further studies to investigate the phylogenetic relationships for the Hispaniola <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> species treated in this revision relative to other Western Hemisphere <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic>.
                        </p>
                        <p>Previous phylogenetic and biogeographic studies of tiger beetle genera in Brazil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Freitag and Barnes 1989</xref>) and West Indies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Freitag 1992</xref>) recognized that <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella sensu</tp:taxon-name></italic> Rivalier possessed a unique suite of synapomorphous adult characters not found in related Western Hemisphere taxa of Cicindelinae. However, their studies treated <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Rivalier 1954</xref> subspecifically within <italic><tp:taxon-name>Cicindela</tp:taxon-name></italic> Linnaeus 1758, a concept held by many North American tiger beetle students, but not by those studying either elsewhere in the world or the higher classifications of Coleoptera. Consequently, in the most recent and comprehensive treatments of the world Geadephaga (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Lorenz 2005</xref>) and Western Hemisphere Caraboidea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Erwin and Pearson 2008</xref>), <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> was recognized as distinct among Cicindelina Latreille 1802 lineages and given full generic status. Although treated as a distinctive genus, the latter authors considered the taxonomic status of species within <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> to be unstable, likely because further discovery of new species would require changes to the current classification. As the present<!--PageBreak--><!--PageBreak--> revision demonstrates, the Neotropical <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> fauna is likely to be far richer than indicated by current faunal lists, especially after habitats have been more fully explored in both new and previously visited geographic areas throughout all seasons. Additionally, more detailed studies of genitalic structures, among populations of those species already described, may reveal cryptic species, as the present revision has shown to be the situation on Hispaniola.
                        </p>
                        <p>Indeed, the discovery and description of new species periodically provides the opportunity to reconsider any existing published phylogeny so that the relationships of the new species to those previously described are better understood. One approach would be to use the criteria of the existing classification and simply fit the new species into it. This first approach seems appropriate when a small number of new species are considered from a restricted geographic area where populations have been adequately sampled such that the faunal diversity is considered to be entirely known. Another approach would be a more comprehensive reevaluation of the criteria of the existing classification in order to develop a revised classification. This second approach would be most appropriate when considering a large number of new species originating over broadly diverse geographic areas. Under this second approach, results would be most informative when populations from all these geographic areas have been adequately sampled.</p>
                        <p>Thus, for either approach the question of adequately sampling existing populations is critical to any meaningful reconstructed phylogeny. Because the present revision revealed new <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> species with each expedition to Hispaniola, there is a high probability that many additional new species will be discovered on this island. Further collecting is likely to find these, not only within new areas and habitats, but also within those previously visited, especially during different seasons on Hispaniola.
                        </p>
                        <p>Even though the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> populations on Hispaniola may not have been completely sampled, this present revision did provide an opportunity for subjective interpretations of the species relationships within this genus on Hispaniola based on the population samples that were collected thus far and studied by the author. These relationships were discussed earlier in this revision under the Remarks within each Species Account. Such interpretations, while based on the author's observations and experience with the species, should provide a working hypothesis for any future phylogenetic analysis designed to examine more rigorously the relationships among the Hispaniolan <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> species, all of which are endemic to this island and superficially appear similar to one another.
                        </p>
                        <p>The current classification into species groups of nearly all <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> described at the time was presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Freitag and Barnes (1989)</xref>. <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella dominicana</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Mandl), described in 1983, unexplainably was overlooked. However, this species later was studied and subsequently assigned to a species group within <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Freitag (1992)</xref>. In their publication, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Freitag and Barnes (1989)</xref> established seven species groups for 29 species within the genus based on a reconstructed phylogeny involving 50 adult morphological characters. Despite the fact that male genitalic characters of most species were not actually examined and documented by dissection, but rather interpreted only from the published descriptions and illustrations, their results were important because they provided a basis for all subsequent efforts to phylogenetically organize the <!--PageBreak--><!--PageBreak-->ever-growing number of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> species found in the Western Hemisphere. The latest catalogue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Erwin and Pearson 2008</xref>) treated 39 <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> species, and with the eight more added in the present revision alone, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> is now at 47 species.
                        </p>
                        <p>Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Freitag and Barnes (1989)</xref> established morphological characters and assigned their polarities--plesiomorphic (ancestral) or apomorphic (derived)--for all 50 adult characters, male and female genitalic characters were given the most value in establishing the species groups within <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> phylogeny. While they treated primarily Brazilian species in their publication, they did establish the <italic>viridicollis</italic> species group for several <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> species occurring in the West Indies together with one species from North America. However, this species group was not discussed in detail until <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Freitag (1992)</xref> studied the West Indian Cicindelidae. In that publication, he reassigned two <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> species he had originally placed within the <italic>viridicollis</italic> species group, and added one species he had previously overlooked, so that the species group at that time included the following three species--<italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella viridicollis</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Dejean 1831) from Cuba, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella dominicana</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Mandl) from Hispaniola, and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella wickhami</tp:taxon-name></italic> (W. Horn 1903) from northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
                        </p>
                        <p>The numerous new species described in the present revision have made it necessary to redefine the earlier concept of the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella viridicollis</tp:taxon-name></italic> species group. Decisions to include newly described species, or exclude those previously described, would result from applying the revised concept. The present revision suggests that the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella viridicollis</tp:taxon-name></italic> species group concept would be strengthened if a previously overlooked adult female structure, a small gibbosity located on each side of the 6<sup>th</sup> abdominal sternum, was included in its concept. This structure, and two membranous structures on the 5<sup>th</sup> abdominal sternum, are considered to be apomorphic. The synapomorphic gibbosity character for females of nearly all Hispaniolan <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic>, as well as, the Cuban <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella virdicollis</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Dejean). provides further evidence for treating the <italic>viridicollis</italic> species group as an evolutionary unit within the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic>. All three structures appear relevant to the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella viridicollis</tp:taxon-name></italic> species group concept and are discussed in detail here.
                        </p>
                        <p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Freitag and Barnes (1989)</xref> were the first to report a membraneous structure along the posterior margin of the female 5<sup>th</sup> sternum. They considered this unusual female abdominal character unique within Western Hemisphere Cicindelinae and termed it an “unpigmented bell-shaped spot”. However, this structure is actually membranous as explained above under Methods; thus, in the present revision it has been termed a “membranous wedge.” The second membranous structure, also on the same female 5<sup>th</sup> abdominal sternum, is a longitudinal “membranous band”, mesad and anterior to this membranous wedge. The membranous band does not seem to have been considered a separate structure by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Freitag and Barnes (1989)</xref>. These two structures exist for nearly all <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> species on Hispaniola. The exceptions being <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella ocoa</tp:taxon-name></italic> whose females are unknown, and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella davidsoni</tp:taxon-name></italic> whose females plausibly have secondarily lost the 5<sup>th</sup> abdominal sternum structures.
                        </p>
                        <p>The third structure is the small, raised gibbosity on each side of the female 6<sup>th</sup> abdominal sternum located mesad on each surface. These two gibbosities have not been previously mentioned in any publication dealing with <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> phylogeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Freitag and Barnes 1989</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Freitag 1992</xref>). As mentioned above, these abdominal gibbosities are considered an important apomorphic character for including or excluding species within the established <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> species groups. The gibbosity character is synapomorphic for females of eight of the nine <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> species on Hispaniola; <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella ocoa</tp:taxon-name></italic> is known only from males, but its females are likely to possess this character.
                        </p>
                        <p>Those species in the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella viridicollis</tp:taxon-name></italic> species group that do not occur on Hispaniola require consideration. Apparently, two subspecies of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella virdicollis</tp:taxon-name></italic> now have been recorded on Cuba; the nominotypic subspecies and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella viridicollis fernandozayasi</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Kippenhan, Ivie &amp; Hopp 2009). <italic><tp:taxon-name>Cicindela fernandozayasi</tp:taxon-name></italic> was proposed as a replacement name (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Kippenhan et al. 2009</xref>) for <italic><tp:taxon-name>Cicindela carbonaria</tp:taxon-name></italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Zayas 1988</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Zayas 1988</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Zayas (1988)</xref> described his species from a single specimen without any detail as to where it was collected on Cuba. This taxon currently is classified as <italic><tp:taxon-name>Cicindela viridicollis fernandozayasi</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Kippenhan, Ivie &amp; Hopp 2009), but treated as a <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> in this revision. This subspecies has a completely black dorsal body color compared to nominotypic <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella viridicollis</tp:taxon-name></italic> with its distinctive blue green head and pronotum contrasting with dull brown elytra covered by metallic blue green flecks.
                        </p>
                        <p>Nominotypic <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella virdicollis</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Dejean) possesses all three of these apomorphic structures on the two last visible sterna based on the author's study of female specimens from Cuba, Cienfuegos Province, Minas Carlota, Sierra de Trinidad, at CMNH. The same cannot be said for the second subspecies because no specimens of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella viridicollis fernandozayasi</tp:taxon-name></italic> were available for examination. This subspecies is known only from its holotype deposited in the Fernando Zayas Collection in Havana, Cuba (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Kippenhan et al. 2009</xref>). There seems little doubt about its placement within the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella viridicollis</tp:taxon-name></italic> species group, however, its subspecific status may need to be reconsidered. The color image of the type presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Kippenhan et al. (2009)</xref> exhibits some morphological characters different from the nominotypic <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella viridicollis</tp:taxon-name></italic> that suggest it may represent a separate species. Although the sex of the holotype of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella viridicollis fernandozayasi</tp:taxon-name></italic> was not indicated when it was described as <italic><tp:taxon-name>Cicindela carbonaria</tp:taxon-name></italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Zayas 1988</xref>, nor when it received its current replacement name, it appears to be a male. The conclusion is based on the expanded setal pads on the proximal three tarsomeres, the shape of its elytral apices and the protruding abdomen from the illustration and image in these two publications. When compared with a male of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella viridicollis</tp:taxon-name></italic>, the most obvious difference between these two subspecies, other than their strikingly different dorsal body color, lies in the large, laterally bulging eyes of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella viridicollis fernandozayasi</tp:taxon-name></italic> compared with the smaller, less bulging eyes of the nominotypic <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella viridicollis</tp:taxon-name></italic>. Final resolution about the specific status of each subspecies must await additional examination of their types, as well as, the discovery of more male specimens of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella viridicollis fernandozayasi</tp:taxon-name></italic> whose genitalia can be dissected.
                        </p>
                        <p>Evidence is presented here that <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella wickhami</tp:taxon-name></italic> (W. Horn) should not be considered part of the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella viridicollis</tp:taxon-name></italic> species group. This species has been included within the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella viridicollis</tp:taxon-name></italic> species group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Freitag and Barnes 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Freitag 1992</xref>) on the basis of its aedeagus having a shield rounded at the apex and slightly protruding from the male genitalia. However, the shield for <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella wickhami</tp:taxon-name></italic> is <!--PageBreak--><!--PageBreak-->actually a more complex sclerite than the simple shield possessed by the other species within the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella viridicollis</tp:taxon-name></italic> species group. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Rivalier (1955)</xref> depicted the shield of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella wickhami</tp:taxon-name></italic> as a large sclerite with both a rounded knob and a pointed section at the apex. My examination of specimens from Arizona at CMNH, confirm this more complex shield shape. Moreover, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella wickhami</tp:taxon-name></italic> females lack the lateral gibbosities on the 6<sup>th</sup> abdominal sternum. From these findings, it is suggested that <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella wickhami</tp:taxon-name></italic> should not be a part of the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> <italic>viridicollis</italic> species group. The assignment of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella wickhami</tp:taxon-name></italic> to another species group within <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> must await a phylogenetic analysis of the other mainland species in the Neotropics of North and Central America.

                        <p>How these current species distributions within the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella viridicollis</tp:taxon-name></italic> species group may have been influenced by their ancestral geographic distributions should be briefly considered. Previous biogeographic studies of tiger beetle genera in the West Indies provided only a partial explanation of the possible pathways by which the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella viridicollis</tp:taxon-name></italic> species group may have arrived on Cuba and Hispaniola from its ancestral distributions. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Freitag (1992)</xref>, the dispersal pathway accounted for the ancestors of the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> on Cuba and Hispaniola. He suggested that these <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> ancestors where originally distributed in Middle America and arrived on these islands most likely through biogeographical patterns of dispersal common to tiger beetles. He did not distinguish between active and passive dispersal mechanisms for the large, actively flying <italic><tp:taxon-name>Cicindela</tp:taxon-name></italic> species compared with the small, primarily cursorial <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> species. Dispersal as a pathway implied movement of species from ancestral distributions in the Yucatan Peninsula or Nicaragua Highlands to the Greater Antilles over wide water gaps. Such dispersal might be rare, but likely has occurred over time even for small <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> species, as documented recently for <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella viridicollis</tp:taxon-name></italic> from Cuba to the Florida Keys(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Schiefer 2004</xref>)<!--PageBreak-->.
                        </p>
                        <p>Although the dispersal pathway undoubtedly has influenced the currrent distribution of the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella viridicollis</tp:taxon-name></italic> species group, the vicariance pathway also should be considered in explaining current geographic distributions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Woodruff (2004)</xref> provided insight into the likely influence of both dispersal and vicariance on the current geographic distributions for <italic><tp:taxon-name>Phyllophaga</tp:taxon-name></italic> species (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Melolonthinae) on Hispaniola. He summarized the concepts about the geologic history of Hispaniola prevalent at the time of his revision.
                        </p>
                        <p><italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> species divergence on Hispaniola apparently occurred after the arrival of the ancestral members of the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella viridicollis</tp:taxon-name></italic> species group. Species divergence likely was greatly influenced by the extent and duration to which populations were isolated, especially during the Pleistocene. During interglacial episodes in that geologic time period, the Caribbean Sea would have risen from melting continental glaciers and inundated the lowlands. Lowland inundation over a long time could have kept populations isolated the longest in the highest and most widely separated mountain masses, such as the Massif de la Hotte in southwestern Haiti, where the most divergent <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella davidsoni</tp:taxon-name></italic> presently exists on Hispaniola. All these biogeographic concepts discussed here should be considered, and discussed in greater detail, when interpreting future phylogenetic studies as to how the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> species on Hispaniola relate to each other, as well as, to the other <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> species in the Neotropics.

            <title>Conclusions</title>
            <p>In the latest and most comprehensive taxonomic treatises of Caraboidea, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> is established as a distinct genus which is confirmed by a suite of synapomorphic characters. Earlier taxonomists, such as Walther Horn, who examined the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> specimens first collected by Philip Darlington in Haiti, assigned all the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> on Hispaniola to the widespread Neotropical <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella argentata</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Fabricius). More recent taxonomists, such as Richard Freitag, considered all the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> specimens on Hispaniola to be the insular endemic <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella dominicana</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Mandl). The current revision of the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> tiger beetle fauna on Hispaniola suggests a greater species diversity exists on this island than previously recognized.
            </p>
            <p>From a comparison of the holotype and paratypes of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella dominicana</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Mandl) with other <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> taken on Hispaniola, it was concluded that this species is restricted to a small area likely along the Rio Bani where it flows from the eastern end of the mountainous Cordillera Central onto the southern coastal plain in the Dominican Republic. A closely related species, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella ocoa</tp:taxon-name></italic>, new species, also occurs allopatrically at low elevations west of this area along the Rio Ocoa near the coast. At high elevations in the Cordillera Central are found two other allopatric species: <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella bellorum</tp:taxon-name></italic>, new species, from the central portions, and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella philipi</tp:taxon-name></italic>, new species, from the north slopes of this mountain range, respectively. Compared with <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella dominicana, Brasiella ocoa</tp:taxon-name></italic> appears to be more closely related, whereas, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella bellorum</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella philipi</tp:taxon-name></italic>,are more distantly related species.
            </p>
            <p>Three endemic species isolated in the Sierra de Baoruco in southern Dominican Republic, appear to be sympatric, but occupy different ecological habitats along an altitudinal gradient. <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella iviei</tp:taxon-name></italic>, new species, the largest species in Hispaniola, occurs in moist, mixed deciduous forests at upper elevations. <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella rawlinsi</tp:taxon-name></italic>, new species, occurs in drier grass and pine dominated habitats at higher elevations, whereas, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella youngi</tp:taxon-name></italic>, new species, occurs in wet, deciduous forested habitats at lower elevations. All three of these species have individuals whose elytral markings are faint or completely obliterated by the darker background color with shiny iridescent flecks. In this regard, these three species appear to be more closely related to each other than to the other <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> species on Hispaniola.
            </p>
            <p>The <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> in neighboring Haiti presently are known to occur only in the highest mountains of that country. <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella darlingtoniana</tp:taxon-name></italic>, new species, from the Massif de la Selle, Haiti, and the most divergent species, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella davidsoni</tp:taxon-name></italic>, new species, from the Massif de la Hotte, Haiti, appear to be more closely related to each other than to the other <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> species on Hispaniola.
            </p>
            <p>All nine <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> species on Hispaniola belong to the <italic>viridicollis</italic> species group within the earlier subgeneric concept of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Cicindela</tp:taxon-name></italic> (<italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic>) as established by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Freitag and Barnes (1989)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Freitag (1992)</xref> from their phylogenetic studies of Brazilian and West Indian tiger beetles. <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella viridicollis viridicollis</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Dejean), and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella viridicollis fernandozayasi</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Kippenhan, Ivie &amp; Hopp) occur on Cuba. Evidence is presented for considering <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella viridicollis fernandozayasi</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Kippenhan, Ivie &amp; Hopp) may represent a distinct species within the species group, and for removing <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella wickhami</tp:taxon-name></italic> (W. Horn) from this species group.<!--PageBreak-->
            </p>
            <p>As elucidated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Freitag (1992)</xref>, ancestors of the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella viridicollis</tp:taxon-name></italic> species group on Hispaniola and Cuba would have arrived there most likely through biogeographical patterns of dispersal common within the Greater Antilles from ancestral distributions in Middle America through the Yucatan Peninsula or Nicaragua Highlands. The degree to which <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> species diverged after arrival on Hispaniola apparently has been greatly influenced by the extent and duration of their isolation during Pleistocene interglacial periods when the Caribbean Sea filled the lowlands. Lowland inundation for long periods of time would likely have isolated populations in separate mountain masses on Hispaniola, thereby fostering species divergence. The most widely separated mountain masses, such as the Massif de la Hotte in southwestern Haiti, in fact, have the most divergent species, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella davidsoni</tp:taxon-name></italic>,presently known on Hispaniola. All the biogeographic concepts of dispersal and vicariance should be discussed in greater detail when interpreting future phylogenetic studies as to how the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Brasiella</tp:taxon-name></italic> species on Hispaniola relate to each other and to those in the Neotropics.

            <p>With grateful appreciation, I acknowledge the assistance of John E. Rawlins and Robert L. Davidson, my colleagues at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, Pittsburgh, PA. This revision was initiated because they gave me opportunities to examine the large series of <italic>Brasiella</italic> specimens collected on several CMNH expeditions throughout Hispaniola. Both men have provided encouragement and support for my tiger beetle research over the years.
            </p>
            <p>My gratitude is extended to Phil Perkins and Brian Farrell, Museum of Comparative Zoology, Harvard, for the opportunity to examine the first <italic>Brasiella</italic> specimens collected on Hispaniola by P.J. Darlington, Jr., in the 1930's, and those collected more recently by Brian Farrell. Special thanks are offered to the following individuals who loaned specimens in their charge: T.L. Erwin, National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution; C. Núñez, Museo Nacional de Historia Natural, Santiago, Dominican Republic; M.A. Ivie, West Indian Beetle Fauna Project Collection, Montana State University, Bozeman, Montana; T.K. Philips, Western Kentucky State University, Bowling Green, Kentucky; D.W. Brzoska, Naples, Florida. I am especially grateful to Johann Probst, Wien, Austria, for donating <italic>Brasiella dominicana</italic> (Mandl) paratypes to CMNH. I very much appreciate the assistance of Manfred Jäch and Heinrich Schönmann, NHM, Wien, Austria, for arranging the loan of <italic>Brasiella dominicana</italic> (Mandl) holotype and paratypes deposited at their institution.
            </p>
            <p>My thanks to Sebastien Batteur who posted images at http://lermit4 taken while he hiked along the entirety of Highway 101 in Haiti early in 2010; these images were most useful for visualizing the habitats in that part of Haiti.A special note of appreciation is extended to Laura Miller, West Virginia Department of Agriculture, Charleston, West Virginia, who very kindly arranged for my access to the Syncroscopy Auto-Montage imaging equipment at her facility used to create all the high quality adult images in this revision. Also, the comments of anonymous reviewers that substantially improved this manuscript are appreciated.</p>
