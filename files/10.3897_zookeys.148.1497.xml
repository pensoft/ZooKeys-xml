        <sec sec-type="Introduction"><title>Introduction</title>
            <p>The genus <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia</tp:taxon-name></italic> in North America comprises about 150 described species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Ascher and Pickering 2011</xref>) that are usually metallic green or blue, sometimes brilliantly so. The 30 species recorded east of the Mississippi River prior to this contribution have been relatively well studied taxonomically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Sandhouse 1939</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Mitchell 1962</xref>), and the internet houses freely available matrix-based and dichotomous keys to the species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Arduser 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Griswold et al. 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Andrus et al. 2010</xref>). As in many other bee genera, the species diversity in eastern North America is depauperate compared to west of the Mississippi River. Nonetheless, there remain many areas in eastern North America that would benefit from increased study and collection effort. In particular, Florida and other states in the southeastern United States appear to house a number of interesting bee endemics, and new state records continue to be documented from this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Hall and Ascher 2010</xref>).</p>
            <p>Herein we describe one such find, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia (Melanosmia) calaminthae</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n., known only from Highlands County, Florida, in sandy scrub at the southern end of the Lake Wales Ridge. This habitat houses many Florida endemic plants and animals, including bees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Deyrup et al. 2002</xref>). <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia calaminthae</tp:taxon-name></italic> is apparently a floral specialist on <italic><tp:taxon-name>Calamintha ashei</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Weath.) Shinners (<tp:taxon-name>Lamiaceae</tp:taxon-name>), Ashe’s Calamint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">4</xref>; also known as Ashe’s Savory), a threatened woody mint found in sand pine/scrub habitat in the Florida central highlands and southeastern Georgia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Coile 2000</xref>). The new species was discovered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Deyrup et al. (2002)</xref> during surveys of the Archbold Biological Station. During subsequent searches by J. S. Ascher, H. G. Hall, and colleagues, including photographer T. Lethbridge, numerous females and a few males were found visiting the host plant in late morning at the Placid Lakes Development southwest of the town of Lake Placid (<named-content content-type="dwc:verbatimCoordinates">N27.250, W81.389</named-content>). At this site the host plant grows commonly in sand scrub, much of which occurs in vacant lots within a partially completed housing subdivision.</p>

            <p><italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia calaminthae</tp:taxon-name></italic> females have modified hairs on the face that readily distinguish the species from similar species of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia</tp:taxon-name></italic> (see Diagnosis, below). Modified facial hairs for collecting pollen from nototribic flowers occur rarely in scattered species across multiple bee families (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Müller 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Ayala and Griswold 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Michener 2007</xref>). In <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia calaminthae</tp:taxon-name></italic>, the hairs on the frons, clypeus, and scape are uniformly short, erect, and simple, and apparently function to trap pollen when the female enters the corolla and her head contacts the anthers of this flower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs 2, 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">5–7</xref>). The pollen accumulates to form a conspicuous mass and evidently remains on the face of the bee for an extended time during foraging bouts (as opposed to being immediately transferred<!--PageBreak--> to the metasomal scopa), as evidenced by conspicuous loads adhering to the face of approximately one-fourth of the female specimens examined. Interestingly, another <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia</tp:taxon-name></italic> that is also found in the southeastern United States, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia (Diceratosmia) conjunctoides</tp:taxon-name></italic> Robertson, new status, has nearly identical hairs on the frons and clypeus of females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 8</xref>). <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia (Diceratosmia) subfasciata miamiensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> Mitchell, 1962, was described as a subspecies but is herein distinguished from typical <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia subfasciata subfasciata</tp:taxon-name></italic> Cresson and newly synonymized under <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia conjunctoides</tp:taxon-name></italic>. Specimens and floral records are scarce for <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia conjunctoides</tp:taxon-name></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Pascarella 2008</xref>); only one examined specimen has an associated floral record, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Crotalaria pumila</tp:taxon-name></italic> Ortega (<tp:taxon-name>Fabaceae</tp:taxon-name>), which limits our interpretation of floral associations for this bee.</p>

            <p>It is the honor of MGR and JSA to dedicate this paper to Kumar Krishna in celebration of his lifelong achievements in the study of <tp:taxon-name>Isoptera</tp:taxon-name>. Both authors are grateful to Kumar and Valerie Krishna for the kindness and generosity shown to them during their respective tenures at the American Museum of Natural History.</p>

        <sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
            <p>The morphological terminology follows that proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Michener (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Harris (1979)</xref>. Mandibular teeth are numbered from ventral-most tooth to dorsal-most tooth. Thus, the ventral-most tooth is the first tooth and the next ventral-most tooth is the second. In the species treated herein, between the second and dorsal-most tooth is a smaller, slightly more interior, cutting edge extended from the dorsal-most tooth, here called the third tooth. The dorsal-most tooth is the fourth tooth.</p>
            <p>The following morphological abbreviations are used: flagellar segment (F), metasomal tergum (T), metasomal sternum (S), and ocellar diameter (OD). Measurements are given for the holotype specimen, with the observed range from other specimens following in parentheses.</p>
            <p>Bee specimens were examined and measured using a Leica MZ12 dissection microscope and ocular micrometer. Pollen grains were slide mounted in silicone oil and examined using a Nikon E200 compound microscope. Photomicrographs of pinned specimens were taken using a Keyence VHX-500F Digital Imaging System.</p>

                    <p>Females of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia calaminthae</tp:taxon-name></italic> are most similar to <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia (Melanosmia) albiventris</tp:taxon-name></italic> Cresson and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia (Melanosmia) cordata</tp:taxon-name></italic> Robertson, sharing with those species the white hairs of the body (including scopa) and four-toothed mandible with the outer and condylar ridges parallel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs 13, 14</xref>). Unlike those species, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia calaminthae</tp:taxon-name></italic> has specialized hairs on the face (including clypeus and frons) that are extremely short, evenly spaced, simple, and stout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figs 5, 6</xref>; longer and finer in <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia albiventris</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia cordata</tp:taxon-name></italic>). In addition, the punctures of the head and mesosoma are large and deeply impressed in <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia calaminthae</tp:taxon-name></italic>, the hairs on the posterior surface of the foretarsal segments are relatively long, the wings are heavily infuscate, the rugose sculpturing of the dorsal propodeal triangle is strongly impressed and well differentiated from the ventral area of shagreened integument (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 15</xref>), and the hairs on the lateral dorsal surface of T1 are dense and long, much more so than on remaining metasomal terga (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs 9, 10</xref>; T1 hairs not conspicuously longer and denser than those on other metasomal terga in <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia albiventris</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia cordata</tp:taxon-name></italic>). <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia (Melanosmia) sandhouseae</tp:taxon-name></italic> Mitchell is a superficially similar species found sympatrically in Florida and is known to visit <italic><tp:taxon-name>Calamintha</tp:taxon-name></italic> in March (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Deyrup et al. 2002</xref>); however, in that species the outer and condylar ridges of the mandible converge apically (parallel in <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia calaminthae</tp:taxon-name></italic>) and the hairs of the clypeus and frons are long and fine.</p>
                    <p>Males of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia calaminthae</tp:taxon-name></italic> are distinguished from many other <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia</tp:taxon-name></italic> by the relatively slender, pointed teeth of T7 (basally about one-fourth the width of the midapical emargination; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 22</xref>). Among the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia</tp:taxon-name></italic> with such slender teeth on T7, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia calaminthae</tp:taxon-name></italic> is extremely similar to <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia cordata</tp:taxon-name></italic> due to the white hairs on the metasomal terga (including laterally on T6) and S4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 24</xref>), and by the hairs on the apical margin of S4 that are longer medially than laterally. <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia calaminthae</tp:taxon-name></italic> can be separated from <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia cordata</tp:taxon-name></italic> by the deep and large punctures on the frons and vertex. Males of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia sandhouseae</tp:taxon-name></italic> Mitchell are superficially similar; however, in that species the punctures on the upper gena are extremely large and deep, much more so than on the vertex, while in <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia calaminthae</tp:taxon-name></italic> the punctures of the upper gena and vertex are subequal in size.</p>

                    <p>Females of this species are distinguished from all other <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diceratosmia</tp:taxon-name></italic>, including typical <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia (Diceratosmia) subfasciata</tp:taxon-name></italic>, by the nearly uniformly short, straight to slightly hooked hairs on the clypeus and slightly longer hairs on the frons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 8</xref>). <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia conjunctoides</tp:taxon-name></italic> is also distinguished from <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia subfasciata</tp:taxon-name></italic> by the scopal hairs: in <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia conjunctoides</tp:taxon-name></italic>, the apical tips of the hairs on S2 and S3 are weakly tapered, while in <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia subfasciata</tp:taxon-name></italic> the hairs are blunt, widened and slightly rounded at their apical tips. The form of clypeal hairs in the female is very similar to that of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia (Melanosmia) calaminthae</tp:taxon-name></italic><!--PageBreak-->; however, in that species the punctures of the metasomal terga are not so large (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figs 16</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">32</xref>), there is no carinate ridge on the hind coxa, the parapsidal line is punctiform, and the metasomal terga (especially T1 and T2) lack the distinct, short, dense, pale, apicolateral hair bands characteristic of subgenus <italic><tp:taxon-name>Diceratosmia</tp:taxon-name></italic> (in <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia calaminthae</tp:taxon-name></italic> T1 has dense, pale hairs, but these hairs are long and contrast with the short, sparse hairs on T2).</p>
                  <p>Males of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia conjunctoides</tp:taxon-name></italic> are extremely similar to <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia (Diceratosmia) subfasciata</tp:taxon-name></italic>. Finding reliable characters to distinguish the two species is made problematic by the <!--PageBreak-->availability of only seven male specimens of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia conjunctoides</tp:taxon-name></italic>. This material suffices to permit the two species to be differentiated by the following characters: In <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia conjunctoides</tp:taxon-name></italic>, the mesoscutum is more finely and densely punctate than in <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia subfasciata</tp:taxon-name></italic> (<italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia conjunctoides</tp:taxon-name></italic> with ca. 16 punctures between parapsidal line and midline, these punctures distinctly smaller than those on the scutellum; <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia subfasciata</tp:taxon-name></italic> with ca. 11 punctures between parapsidal line and midline, these punctures about the same size as those on the scutellum). In dorsal view, T1 of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia conjunctoides</tp:taxon-name></italic> is less concave along its anterior margin, while in <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia subfasciata</tp:taxon-name></italic> the anterior margin is strongly curved, forming anterolaterally rounded corners. In addition, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia conjunctoides</tp:taxon-name></italic> is usually a slightly larger bee than <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia subfasciata</tp:taxon-name></italic> (6–7 mm vs. 8–9 mm); all examined <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia conjunctoides</tp:taxon-name></italic> from Florida and Georgia are dark blue, while all examined <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia subfasciata</tp:taxon-name></italic> from throughout its range are a paler greenish blue; however, the male specimen of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia conjunctoides</tp:taxon-name></italic> from Mississippi is greenish blue, similar to <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia subfasciata</tp:taxon-name></italic>. In <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia conjunctoides</tp:taxon-name></italic>, the lower propodeal triangle tends to be weakly shagreened throughout, while in <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia subfasciata</tp:taxon-name></italic> the lower propodeal triangle tends to be shining. In addition, T6 of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia conjunctoides</tp:taxon-name></italic> has an apical, upturned flange that is longer than in examined specimens of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia subfasciata</tp:taxon-name></italic> (ca. 2.0 adjacent puncture diameters in the former versus 1.0 adjacent puncture diameters in the latter).</p>

                    <p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Michener (1949</xref>: 264) considered a male specimen of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia conjunctoides</tp:taxon-name></italic> from northern peninsular Florida to intergrade with the typical <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia subfasciata</tp:taxon-name></italic> in features of T6 and T7 (although not in color). However, he was apparently unaware of the distinct facial and scopal hair features distinguishing females of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia conjunctoides</tp:taxon-name></italic> from <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia subfasciata</tp:taxon-name></italic>. Specimens of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia conjunctoides</tp:taxon-name></italic> that we have examined from northern peninsular Florida as well as Mississippi and Georgia are consistent with those from southern Florida in these diagnostic features of the females as well as in the finer punctures of the male mesoscutum. Although <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia conjunctoides</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia subfasciata</tp:taxon-name></italic> <italic>sensu stricto</italic> are extremely similar in the male S4, we do not agree<!--PageBreak--> with the historic placements of this bee as a subspecies or synonym of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia subfasciata</tp:taxon-name></italic> due to the consistent differences in male punctation and female clypeal and scopal hairs.</p>
                    <p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Mitchell (1962</xref>: 84), two additional female paratype specimens of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia subfasciata miamiensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> exist in Raleigh with the same label data as the male allotype. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Pascarella (2008)</xref> also recorded the species from “Charlotte Harbor,” possibly based on distributional records found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Michener (1949)</xref>, but we have not been able to confirm this record. Until we have access to further material, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia conjunctoides</tp:taxon-name></italic> is provisionally considered to range from southern Florida north to Georgia and Mississippi, while we can confirm the presence of typical <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia subfasciata</tp:taxon-name></italic> from northeastern Mexico and southeastern California southeast to Alabama and South Carolina, and northeast to Illinois and New Jersey.</p>

                <p>As indicated by its specific epithet, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia calaminthae</tp:taxon-name></italic> appears to be closely associated with the woody mint <italic><tp:taxon-name>Calamintha ashei</tp:taxon-name></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">4</xref>). Individual plants of this species may persist for at least a decade, possibly considerably longer. The flowering period is primarily from mid-March through mid-April; there can be variation in flowering phenology within this main blooming period among individuals growing in close proximity. Individual mature plants present hundreds of flowers over a period of several weeks. For flower visitors, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Calamintha ashei</tp:taxon-name></italic> provides a dependable annual resource, even when the population of mature plants is small; as few as 20–30 plants may produce thousands of flowers each season.</p>
                <p>Flowers have a corolla about 7 mm long, strongly protected against nectar-robbers by a stiff calyx that subsequently functions as a seed capsule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">4</xref>). There is almost no evidence of nectar robbing. Pollen is produced by four anthers whose filaments lie along the fused upper petals. Anthers are arranged in two rows, approximately marking the corners of a square (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). In late morning and early afternoon when the anthers open, visiting female <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia calaminthae</tp:taxon-name></italic> rapidly bob their heads three to four times upon entering a flower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs 2, 3</xref>). This behavior, unusual in bees, might be associated with dislodging pollen, although this remains to be investigated. Pollen grains scraped from the head of one paratype specimen of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia calaminthae</tp:taxon-name></italic> were found to be consistent with those described for <italic><tp:taxon-name>Calamintha</tp:taxon-name></italic>: three ridges were observed in lateral view, suggesting a hexacolpate condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Trudel and Morton 1991</xref>). The behavior exhibited by <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia calaminthae</tp:taxon-name></italic> has not been observed in 23 other species of bees that visit flowers of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Calamintha ashei</tp:taxon-name></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Deyrup et al. 2002</xref>). Approximately one-fourth of the examined females had a large quantity of pollen trapped on the clypeus, supraclypeal area, frons, and scape (i.e., with pollen masses conspicuously visible to the naked eye, similar to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 7</xref>). The large pollen load on the face suggests that females of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia calaminthae</tp:taxon-name></italic> do not immediately groom the pollen back to the scopa when foraging between flowers. Such large pollen masses may even indicate that females are able to use the modified hairs on the face, in addition to the metasomal scopa which also contained pollen, to transport pollen to the nest; however, this was not directly observed and should be investigated in the future.</p>
                <!--PageBreak-->
                <p>Flowers of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Calamintha ashei</tp:taxon-name></italic> are also visited by flies in the family <tp:taxon-name>Bombyliidae</tp:taxon-name>: <italic><tp:taxon-name>Bombylius</tp:taxon-name></italic> spp., <italic><tp:taxon-name>Systoechus solitus</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Walker), <italic><tp:taxon-name>Geron</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Toxophora</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp., as well as a member of the <tp:taxon-name>Syrphidae</tp:taxon-name>: <italic><tp:taxon-name>Copestylum florida</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Hull). The occurrence of numerous alternative potential pollinators adds some resilience to a pollination system that includes a rare plant and an apparently specialized bee. The only species of visitor that occurs in large enough numbers to be suspected of being a disruptive competitor in some patches of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Calamintha ashei</tp:taxon-name></italic> is the European Honey Bee, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Apis mellifera</tp:taxon-name></italic> Linnaeus.</p>
                <p>The known distribution and natural history of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia calaminthae</tp:taxon-name></italic> suggest that it may be among the most geographically restricted and host specific bees in eastern North America. It is possible that <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia calaminthae</tp:taxon-name></italic> has wider geographic and host plant ranges than now known, as there has never been a comprehensive attempt to survey the bees of Florida, or to document their hosts. There are, however, biogeographic factors that could explain narrow geographic and host ranges for this species.</p>
                <p><italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia calaminthae</tp:taxon-name></italic> is known from Florida scrub habitat on the southern half of the Lake Wales Ridge. Florida scrub is a unique shrub community found on ridges and knolls of wind-deposited silica sand. Vegetation consists of small, sclerophyllous oaks and a variety of other shrubs and small trees. The low and open structure of the habitat is maintained by occasional fires. For a more complete description of Florida scrub, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Myers (1990)</xref>. An important sub-category of Florida scrub habitat is the “scrub rosemary bald.” Scrub Rosemary, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Ceratiola ericoides</tp:taxon-name></italic> Michx. (also known as Sandhill- or Florida-Rosemary, or Sand Heath), is an aberrant member of the Ericaceae that occurs on the most highly drained scrub sites, often forming nearly pure stands of bushes that grow to be about 1.5 m high, with patches of bare sand between the clumps of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Calamintha ericoides</tp:taxon-name></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Johnson 1982</xref>). <italic><tp:taxon-name>Calamintha ashei</tp:taxon-name></italic> and several other narrowly distributed Florida scrub specialist plants seem to need bare sand patches in scrub rosemary balds, although some of these plants can move into areas of bare sand caused by human disturbance. Several of the plants found in rosemary balds have host-specific insects, including <italic><tp:taxon-name>Calamintha ashei</tp:taxon-name></italic>, which is the host of the plant bug <italic><tp:taxon-name>Keltonia clinopodii</tp:taxon-name></italic> Kelton (<tp:taxon-name>Miridae</tp:taxon-name>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Kelton 1966</xref>). Palynological evidence shows that <italic><tp:taxon-name>Ceratiola</tp:taxon-name></italic> barrens were much more widespread in south Florida at various times during the last 40,000 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Delcourt and Delcourt 1981</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Trapnell et al. 2007</xref>).</p>
                <p>The Lake Wales Ridge, especially its southern half where <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia calaminthae</tp:taxon-name></italic> occurs, is the area with the largest number of Florida scrub specialist arthropods and plants, and has the only concentration of scrub specialists not found elsewhere in Florida (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Deyrup 1990</xref>). This is probably due to the large size of the Lake Wales Ridge, its relative antiquity (over one million years), its southern position, and its uneven topography, which may affect fire frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Deyrup 1990</xref>). About 90 species of Florida scrub specialist arthropods are known from the Lake Wales Ridge, although many of these also occur in scrub areas elsewhere in Florida (Deyrup 2011, unpublished list). <italic><tp:taxon-name>Calamintha ashei</tp:taxon-name></italic> is largely restricted to the Lake Wales Ridge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Turner et al. 2006</xref>). Another spring-blooming woody mint, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Conradina brevifolia</tp:taxon-name></italic> Shinners, has a similar floral structure, although it is yet to be associated with <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia calaminthae</tp:taxon-name></italic>. <italic><tp:taxon-name>Conradina brevifolia</tp:taxon-name></italic> is largely restricted to a small area on the Lake Wales Ridge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Turner et al. 2006</xref>).</p>
                <!--PageBreak-->
                <p><italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia calaminthae</tp:taxon-name></italic> is currently known from only four sites within an area about 20 km long and 2 km wide on the Lake Wales Ridge. Archbold Biological Station is a private research station on the southern end of the Lake Wales Ridge where natural habitats have been protected since 1941. Two other protected sites are Lake Wales Ridge Wildlife and Environmental Areas managed by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. One of these areas, Gould Road Preserve, has a large population of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Calamintha ashei</tp:taxon-name></italic> and apparently a substantial population of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia calaminthae</tp:taxon-name></italic>, but the site is unfenced and subject to pesticide drift from adjacent orange groves. The other protected site, Holmes Avenue Preserve, also has a large population of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Calamintha ashei</tp:taxon-name></italic>, but is similarly unfenced, includes a large number of small, unacquired private parcels, and is subject to destructive use by off-road vehicles. There are over 20 Florida scrub preserves on the Lake Wales Ridge, but many of these lack large populations of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Calamintha ashei</tp:taxon-name></italic>. The majority of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia calaminthae</tp:taxon-name></italic> records are from scattered undeveloped lots in Placid Lakes, a platted subdivision south of the town of Lake Placid; this collection area is unprotected.</p>
                <p>The nest site of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia calaminthae</tp:taxon-name></italic> is unknown, but nest sites are less likely to be a limiting factor for this species than a scarcity of floral hosts and habitat. If nests are in dead wood, fires that remove most dead wood could affect populations of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia calaminthae</tp:taxon-name></italic>.</p>
                <p>Considering all the factors discussed above, attention should be given to the conservation needs of this recently discovered bee. The type locality of this species, where most known individuals have been observed, photographed, and collected, is a site with many vacant lots within a subdivision. Future full residential development at this site would threaten much of the known habitat of this species. <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia calaminthae</tp:taxon-name></italic>, remains, however, an extremely poorly known insect. It has a short flight period, and is therefore easily overlooked. It could be more abundant and widespread than it appears at present. Surveys of additional potential habitat, i.e., areas of sand scrub where the host plant occurs, are urgently needed to better assess whether the few known sites are critical habitat for the species or if it is more widely distributed but under recorded.</p>

            <sec sec-type="Osmia conjunctoides"><title><tp:taxon-name>Osmia conjunctoides</tp:taxon-name></title>
              <p>Unfortunately, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia conjunctoides</tp:taxon-name></italic> has been too rarely collected to allow for more than a few speculative comments on its conservation status; none of the authors have seen this bee in life. Only one examined specimen, the holotype of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia subfasciata miamiensis</tp:taxon-name></italic>, has a recorded host plant associated with it (<italic><tp:taxon-name>Crotalaria pumila</tp:taxon-name></italic> Ortega); thus, it is not possible to say if the species is restricted in its plant host use. However, the presence of nearly uniformly short, erect hairs on the face of females is rare among <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia</tp:taxon-name></italic> in North America; in fact, this particular facial hair morphology is only known from <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia conjunctoides</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia calaminthae</tp:taxon-name></italic>. It is therefore reasonable to suspect that <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia conjunctoides</tp:taxon-name></italic> is associated with a restricted set of floral host species or with a particular floral morphology. At least six other <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia</tp:taxon-name></italic> from North America have facial hair modifications suggestive of pollen collection from nototribic flowers (V. H. Gonzalez, Griswold, &amp; Rightmyer, unpublished data); the hairs on these bees either form a basket of stiff, proclinate hairs on the vertex and frons, or are cork-screw shaped on the clypeus and frons. Although the <!--PageBreak-->hair morphology is not identical, the placement of the modified hairs on the clypeus and frons appears to be associated with pollen collection from nototribic flowers in both Old and New World <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia</tp:taxon-name></italic>, usually from the family <tp:taxon-name>Lamiaceae</tp:taxon-name> (although polylecty with preference for both <tp:taxon-name>Lamiaceae</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Fabaceae</tp:taxon-name> has been documented; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Müller 1996</xref>) or <tp:taxon-name>Scrophulariaceae</tp:taxon-name>.</p>
                <p>A strong association of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia conjunctoides</tp:taxon-name></italic> with <italic><tp:taxon-name>Crotalaria pumila</tp:taxon-name></italic> is tenuous. This legume has anthers that are enclosed in a narrow passageway in the keel, and it is not yet known if a bee collecting pollen or nectar would contact the anthers of this plant with her head. However, in alfalfa (<italic><tp:taxon-name>Medicago sativa</tp:taxon-name></italic> Linnaeus), another plant in the family <tp:taxon-name>Fabaceae</tp:taxon-name> (albeit an unusual one), the act of pollination changes the placement of the anthers from a ventral position to a more dorsal one (i.e., “tripping” the flower, causing the staminal column to snap upward toward the banner petal; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Pitts-Singer and Cane 2011</xref>). Indeed, for <italic><tp:taxon-name>Medicago sativa</tp:taxon-name></italic>, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Megachile rotundata</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Fabricius) is preferred over honey bees for managed pollination due to its tolerance for being struck repeatedly on the head by the anthers of this flower.  Thus, although <italic><tp:taxon-name>Crotolaria</tp:taxon-name></italic> is not likely the main host plant of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia conjunctoide</tp:taxon-name></italic>s, it cannot be ruled out until field observations have taken place. It is also unknown if the distribution of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Crotolaria pumila</tp:taxon-name></italic> has any predictive value for the distribution of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia conjunctoides</tp:taxon-name></italic>. However, as it is the only floral information available to us for <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia conjunctoides</tp:taxon-name></italic> we provide a few comments on the natural history of this plant species and a related species within the same genus. <italic><tp:taxon-name>Crotalaria pumila</tp:taxon-name></italic> occurs in beach dunes and coastal pinelands along the Atlantic Coast from Brevard County south (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Taylor 1998</xref>). Although much of this range has been heavily developed or overrun by exotic plants, patches of native habitat can be found in a series of coastal preserves, the largest of which are Jonathan Dickinson State Park, Hobe Sound National Wildlife Preserve, and Merritt Island National Wildlife Preserve. Cape Florida, where the holotype of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia subfasciata miamiensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> was collected, might still have a protected population of this species within Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park. St. Catherines Island is a National Historic Landmark and is also a protected area. <italic><tp:taxon-name>Crotalaria rotundifolia</tp:taxon-name></italic> Walter ex J. F. Gmel. might also be a potential plant to investigate when searching for further specimens of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia conjunctoides</tp:taxon-name></italic>; <italic><tp:taxon-name>Crotolaria rotundifolia</tp:taxon-name></italic> is more widespread in Florida, and inland populations are dependent upon fire. The most recently collected specimens were from a burn zone in Seminole County. Thus, open, frequently burned or disturbed areas (i.e., Brooksville Ridge in Citrus and Levy Counties) are potential habitat.</p>
                <p>Until further individuals of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Osmia conjunctoides</tp:taxon-name></italic> have been located and studied, the conservation status of this species will remain unclear. It is potentially an endangered species, considering the massive scale of destruction and alteration of most of its presumed coastal habitat. The decrease of fire frequency in many inland areas of the southeastern United States may also be a factor in this species’ conservation status, although the species has yet to be associated with a fire-dependent plant.</p>
