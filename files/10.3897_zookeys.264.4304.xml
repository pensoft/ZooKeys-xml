        <sec sec-type="Introduction">
            <title>Introduction</title>
            <p>A website devoted to the macromoths (excluding the <tp:taxon-name>Geometridae</tp:taxon-name>) of the Pacific Northwest was recently created by a team that includes the authors of the current paper. The Pacific Northwest (PNW) is defined as all of Idaho, Oregon, and Washington and the western part of Montana in the United States and all of British Columbia in Canada. This site, called Pacific Northwest Moths (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pnwmoths.biol.wwu.edu/">http://pnwmoths.biol.wwu.edu/</ext-link> ), has been available to the public since July 2012. The Internet format–as opposed to a book or journal article–lends itself to continuous updating of things such as additional species, range extensions and life histories. However, it is not an appropriate format for taxonomic work intended for a larger audience, nor does it satisfy the requirements for the description of new taxa.</p>
            <p>We are aware of several undescribed species of <tp:taxon-name>Erebidae</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Noctuidae</tp:taxon-name> in the Pacific Northwest (PNW). Three of these are described here so that they can be included on the website.</p>
            <p>The thorough vetting of PNW moth collections that was part of the website work confirmed that three superficially distinctive populations of previously named moths are isolated segregates. These are sufficiently different to warrant recognition as subspecies, a taxonomic category that we reserve for populations that are both geographically isolated and differ significantly in appearance from other populations of their species. Three subspecies are named in this paper.</p>
            <p>One of the new PNW species is in the genus <italic><tp:taxon-name>Resapamea</tp:taxon-name></italic> Varga &amp; Ronkay (<tp:taxon-name>Noctuidae</tp:taxon-name>). This presents an opportunity to name two additional species in this genus even though they are from parts of western North America outside the PNW.</p>
            <p>A large number of taxonomic changes in the superfamily <tp:taxon-name>Noctuoidea</tp:taxon-name> have recently been advanced in a new check list for North America north of Mexico (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Lafontaine and Schmidt 2010</xref>) and in the first update to this list (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Lafontaine and Schmidt 2011</xref>). Additional synonyms to those published by these authors were discovered during the website work, usually because a PNW species is known by more than one name. The new synonyms that are discussed in this paper are in the genera <italic><tp:taxon-name>Chytolita</tp:taxon-name></italic> Grote (<tp:taxon-name>Erebidae</tp:taxon-name>) and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia</tp:taxon-name></italic> Guenée (<tp:taxon-name>Noctuidae</tp:taxon-name>).</p>
            <p>The genus <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia</tp:taxon-name></italic> is represented by <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia perobliqua</tp:taxon-name></italic> Hampson and the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia obliqua</tp:taxon-name></italic> species-group in the PNW. The number of species in the latter group <!--PageBreak-->is confusing to collectors, with seemingly more names than species. An attempt by the senior author to revise it in the late 1990s was never published because of difficulties in assigning species boundaries using standard morphological methods. More recent DNA data allows many of these issues to be resolved. The PNW species <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia obliqua</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Harvey) and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia medialis</tp:taxon-name></italic> Smith are discussed and illustrated herein, and the type locality of the third North American species in the species-group, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia intermedia</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Barnes &amp; Benjamin), is restricted.</p>
            <p>This paper is arranged in check list order following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Lafontaine and Schmidt (2010)</xref>.</p>

            <title>Materials and methods</title>
            <p>Genitalia were prepared using standard methods for inflating the male vesica and female bursa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Lafontaine 2004</xref>). Terminology for wing markings and anatomy also follows Lafontaine (op. cit.) except in <italic><tp:taxon-name>Drasteria</tp:taxon-name></italic> Hübner (<tp:taxon-name>Erebidae</tp:taxon-name>) where they are modified from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Metlevski and Zolnerowich (2009)</xref>. The term ductus bursae is used herein for the entire length of the tube connecting the ostium bursae to the corpus bursae. Metlevski and Zolnerowich (op. cit.) divide this structure into two parts–the ductus bursae and antrum–restricting the use of ductus bursae to the anterior sclerotized portion. In <italic><tp:taxon-name>Resapamea</tp:taxon-name></italic>, a stout process extending dorsad from the base of the sacculus is herein named the basal saccular process. This structure was called the clavus by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Zilli et al. (2005)</xref>, a term that is potentially confusing because the term clavus has been used previously for a rod-like sensory organ with apical setae located adjacent to the base of the valve in some noctuid genera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Forbes 1954</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Lafontaine 2004</xref>).</p>
            <p>The sequence of the 658 base pair “barcode” region of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase <italic>c</italic> subunit 1 (hereafter called CO1 or barcode) were obtained from the Barcodes of Life initiative through the courtesy of Dr. J. Donald Lafontaine. Only pre-existing data were used during this study. The barcode sequences were compared using phylograms constructed using the Kimura-2-Parameter distance model as implemented on the BOLD Systems website (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Ratnasingham and Hebert 2007</xref>).</p>

                        <p><bold>Head</bold> – Antenna of male moderately bipectinate with each branch covered with fine cilia, black, dorsal shaft covered with light-gray scales. Female unknown. Scape light to medium dark gray with slightly lighter underside. Eye rounded, smooth. Labial palp moderately short with short apical segment, covered by short flat scales except slightly longer at ventral base; basal half yellow and distal half dark gray. Head covered in hair-like yellow scales except inferior and lateral border of frons whitish gray. <bold>Thorax</bold> – Vestiture of simple hair-like scales, light to medium dark brownish gray, slightly browner than forewing color, anterior portion near head yellow. Prothoracic collar slightly lighter than central thorax, with a gradual transition to yellow on each side. Tegula covered by long hair-like scales, lighter cream than central thorax. Legs: femur of foreleg yellow with gray ventral surface; other femora and the tibiae of all legs slightly brownish gray, smoky gray dorsally and lighter gray ventrally, tibiae lacking spiniform setae; tarsi light tan gray with a slight ochre tint, with three rows of short spiniform setae on each segment. <bold>Wings</bold> – Forewing length: males 19–20 mm. Forewing nearly even slightly smoky brownish gray, slightly darker on distal third; most specimens with a thin pale streak in fold and approximately half of specimens with veins on distal wing, cubital vein, and 1A+2A similarly pale. Transverse lines and all spots absent. Fringe white with base gray like terminal wing. Dorsal hindwing slightly brownish gray, slightly darker than forewing; half of specimens with slightly paler veins similar to those on forewing, lacking lines and discal spot. Hindwing fringe white with gray base. <bold>Abdomen</bold> – Color light putty gray with dorsal half of segments I–VI dark orange yellow; with rows of half-round black spots on segments I–VII comprised of a single larger spot in the dorsal midline and smaller rounded spots on lateral abdomen adjacent to lighter venter; ventral segment VII with a bilobed protuberance covered by modified scales <!--PageBreak-->(likely for pheromones). <bold>Male genitalia</bold> – Uncus short, hook-like, evenly tapered to a point, flanked on each side by a large strongly sclerotized block-like process directed posterolaterally with dorsal surface smoothly convex and ventral aspect concave, covered dorsally by innumerable velvety setae. Valve simple, membranous and strap-like, 3 × as long as wide; sacculus modified into a large sclerotized thorn-like process approximately 0.6 × as long and wide as valve, with acute tip directed slightly posteromedially. Aedeagus 7 × as long as wide, mesially constricted, with a pointed narrow cylindrical process arising from ventral aspect of distal third just to left of midline, projecting posteriorly and 20° toward right, and curving slightly dorsad. Vesica approximately 2/3 × as long as aedeagus, curved 90° dorsad from the tip of the aedeagus, with a large elongate conical apical diverticulum directed anteriorly–producing appearance of entire vesica curving 180°–and bearing a small basal patch of short cornuti. <bold>Female genitalia</bold> – Unknown.</p>

                        <p>This subspecies is restricted to gravel prairies south of Puget Sound, Washington. These prairies were created by the outwash from the Vashon Lobe of the Pleistocene glaciation, and might have been maintained as open prairies by burning by native humans to promote the growth of camas lilies (<italic><tp:taxon-name>Camassia</tp:taxon-name></italic> spp., <tp:taxon-name>Liliaceae</tp:taxon-name>) as a food source. The moth is associated with Dogbane (<italic><tp:taxon-name>Apocynum</tp:taxon-name></italic> spp., <tp:taxon-name>Apocynaceae</tp:taxon-name>), the known foodplant of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Camassia oregonensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> elsewhere in North America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Tietz 1972</xref>). This is almost certainly the larval foodplant of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Camassia oregonensis tristis</tp:taxon-name></italic>, although this has not been confirmed. This moth flies during June and July.</p>

                        <p><italic><tp:taxon-name>Cycnia oregonensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> is found in a large part of North America, occurring from coast to coast and from the border with Mexico north to central Saskatchewan and Nova Scotia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Covell 1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Ferguson et al. 2000</xref>). This range includes much of the PNW, including western Oregon and the area east of the Cascade Range as far north as south-central British Columbia. Throughout most of its range it is nearly uniform in color and pattern. <italic><tp:taxon-name>Cycnia oregonensis tristis</tp:taxon-name></italic> is limited to a small area near Olympia, Washington and is the only known population of this species in Washington west of the Cascades. It is distinctly grayer and less patterned than all other populations, but has an identical CO1 barcode sequence.</p>
                        <p>The type specimen of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Euchaetes oregonensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> Stretch was collected by Lord Walsingham on a trip through Oregon during 1871–1872 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Stretch 1872–[1874]</xref>). Comparison of his itinerary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Essig 1941</xref>) with the flight period of the moth suggests strongly that it was collected in the southwestern corner of the state between Roseburg and the California border. <italic><tp:taxon-name>Cycnia oregonensis tristis</tp:taxon-name></italic> is separated from the closest west-side populations in western Oregon by 225 kilometers. All of the specimens of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Camassia oregonensis oregonensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> examined from near the likely type locality are similar to those from elsewhere in North America.</p>
                        <p>The Puget Prairies where <italic><tp:taxon-name>Camassia oregonensis tristis</tp:taxon-name></italic> flies are inhabited by several other distinctive <tp:taxon-name>Lepidoptera</tp:taxon-name> with limited distributions, including the noctuid moth <italic><tp:taxon-name>Apamea inordinata olympia</tp:taxon-name></italic> Crabo and several uncommon butterflies.</p>

                        <p>Two species of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Chytolita</tp:taxon-name></italic> Grote have until now been recognized for North America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Lafontaine and Schmidt 2010</xref>): <italic><tp:taxon-name>Chytolita morbidalis</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Guenée) and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Chytolita petrealis</tp:taxon-name></italic> Grote. Both species names have at various times been used for material collected in the PNW; however, only a single species with slight variation in size and darkness exists in this region. Material from eastern North America, the type specimens of the available names, and material previously submitted for CO1 sequencing were therefore examined to attempt to elucidate the correct name for the PNW species. It was found that there is virtually no variation in barcodes in this genus despite the fact that the sample is diverse and includes larger light-colored specimens identified as <italic><tp:taxon-name>Chytolita morbidalis</tp:taxon-name></italic> and smaller dark ones submitted as <italic><tp:taxon-name>Chytolita petrealis</tp:taxon-name></italic> from a large portion of eastern North America. The two previously recognized species have been described as “identical in pattern” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Forbes 1954</xref>) and were only distinguished by size and darkness without structural differences. The dark small forms known as <italic><tp:taxon-name>Chytolita petrealis</tp:taxon-name></italic> are from swamps and acid bogs (Forbes op. cit.) and are consistent with an ecophenotype. This evidence indicates that <italic><tp:taxon-name>Chytolita petrealis</tp:taxon-name></italic> Grote is a synonym of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Herminea morbidalis</tp:taxon-name></italic> Guenée.</p>
                        <p>The two syntypes of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Herminea morbidalis</tp:taxon-name></italic> Guenée could not be located and might be lost; however, the original description is sufficient to identify the species and associate it with the genus <italic><tp:taxon-name>Chytolita</tp:taxon-name></italic> based on features of the labial palpus and the presence of an accessory cell on the forewing. A neotype designation is not necessary since there is only one <italic><tp:taxon-name>Chytolita</tp:taxon-name></italic> species in North America.</p>

In the Pacific Northwest <italic><tp:taxon-name>Drasteria parallela</tp:taxon-name></italic> is most likely to be confused with <italic><tp:taxon-name>Drasteria divergens</tp:taxon-name></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 5</xref>), which is similar in size and has a similarly colored orange hindwing. They can be distinguished without dissection by the pattern of the medial areas of both wings. The forewing medial line of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Drasteria parallela</tp:taxon-name></italic> is double with parallel component, whereas <italic><tp:taxon-name>Drasteria divergens</tp:taxon-name></italic> has a single broader medial line. On the hindwing, the discal spot of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Drasteria parallela</tp:taxon-name></italic> is nearly rectangular and the veins between it and the postmedial line are dark and contrasting. The discal spot of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Drasteria divergens</tp:taxon-name></italic> is joined broadly to the postmedial line giving it a long curved C-shape and the adjacent veins are orange. They also differ in other features of the maculation, including a smoother subterminal line in <italic><tp:taxon-name>Drasteria parallela</tp:taxon-name></italic>.</p>

In <italic><tp:taxon-name>Drasteria divergens</tp:taxon-name></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 35</xref>) the right clasper is longer and more slender than the left and the posterodorsal valvulae are angular. <italic><tp:taxon-name>Drasteria parallela</tp:taxon-name></italic> has a relatively short and wide costal process of the right valve compared to that of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Drasteria convergens</tp:taxon-name></italic> in which it is long and narrow. In the vesica, the posteriorly-directed process arising from the glove-like diverticulum on the left side of the dorsal vesica is conical in <italic><tp:taxon-name>Drasteria parallela</tp:taxon-name></italic> and conical with two small finger-like projections in <italic><tp:taxon-name>Drasteria convergens</tp:taxon-name></italic>.</p>

                        <p>The name is derived from the Latin <italic>diluvium</italic> meaning deluge or flood. The Columbia Basin where this moth occurs in Washington was scoured repeatedly by cataclysmic floods at the end of the Ice Age.</p>

                        <p><italic><tp:taxon-name>Resapamea diluvius</tp:taxon-name></italic> is most likely to be confused with <italic><tp:taxon-name>Resapemea passer</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Guenée) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs 12–14</xref>), a common and widespread moth in North America. <italic><tp:taxon-name>Resapamea passer</tp:taxon-name></italic> is found in the Pacific Northwest where it flies on both sides of the Cascade Mountains, including at the type locality of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Resapamea diluvius</tp:taxon-name></italic>. <italic><tp:taxon-name>Resapamea diluvius</tp:taxon-name></italic> is less variable than <italic><tp:taxon-name>Resapamea passer</tp:taxon-name></italic>, which comes in a range in colors and patterns that includes dark brown, reddish brown, dull light yellow brown, or a mixture of light- and dark-brown forms. <italic><tp:taxon-name>Resapamea diluvius</tp:taxon-name></italic> is dark hoary gray brown or red brown, grayer than <italic><tp:taxon-name>Resapamea passer</tp:taxon-name></italic> on both wings, with a more streaky pattern distal to the cell due to pale-gray veins. A few specimens of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Resapamea passer</tp:taxon-name></italic> have streaky distal forewings, but this is due to dark veins against a lighter ground (the veins of most <italic><tp:taxon-name>Resapamea passer</tp:taxon-name></italic> are dark gray under magnification but do not contrast with the ground color). Most specimens of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Resapamea diluvius</tp:taxon-name></italic> have the streaky pattern accentuated by black between the veins in the distal subterminal area and terminal area across the width of the wing. In <italic><tp:taxon-name>Resapamea passer</tp:taxon-name></italic>, black scaling on the distal wing is uncommon, and is usually limited to the area distal to the cell and in the fold. Finally, white or cream in the lateral reniform spot is typical in <italic><tp:taxon-name>Resapamea diluvius</tp:taxon-name></italic>, whereas pale scales in the spot are variable in <italic><tp:taxon-name>Resapamea passer</tp:taxon-name></italic>: absent, darker yellow or tan if limited to the lateral portion, or filling the entire spot. Habitat association with dunes and early flight period are also characteristic of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Resapamea diluvius</tp:taxon-name></italic>, whereas <italic><tp:taxon-name>Resapamea passer</tp:taxon-name></italic> is found in a variety of wetland and agricultural habitats and usually flies later in the summer with a peak during late June and July.</p>
                        <p>The male genitalia of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Resapamea diluvius</tp:taxon-name></italic> are similar to those of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Resapamea passer</tp:taxon-name></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 39</xref>). The cucullus of the valve is more massive than that of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Resapamea passer</tp:taxon-name></italic>, especially relative to the width of the valve, and the anal margin is more rounded. In the vesicas, the diverticulum bearing a ridge of spines (cock’s comb) on the ventral surface is positioned slightly closer to the base in <italic><tp:taxon-name>Resapamea diluvius</tp:taxon-name></italic>, is smaller in size, and has a less pronounced ridge of spines than in <italic><tp:taxon-name>Resapamea passer</tp:taxon-name></italic>.</p>
                        <p>The female genitalia of these species are also similar. The bursa copulatrix of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Resapamea diluvius</tp:taxon-name></italic> is rounder than that of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Resapamea passer</tp:taxon-name></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 51</xref>), with the ratio of length to width approximately 1.5 in <italic><tp:taxon-name>Resapamea diluvius</tp:taxon-name></italic> and 1.75 in <italic><tp:taxon-name>Resapamea passer</tp:taxon-name></italic>.</p>

Terminal line a series of black chevrons on veins. Orbicular and reniform spots completely or partially outlined in black; orbicular spot variably absent, faint, or prominent, a small to medium-sized oval filled with color of adjacent wing; reniform spot moderate sized, weakly to strongly kidney shaped, filled with white to cream laterally, less prominently inferiorly, and in a few specimens as an incomplete row of medial scales, ground color medially, and with a central dark-gray to black lunule that is strongest at posterior end. Claviform spot black, strongest anteriorly, narrow, small to moderate sized, filled with ground color or a darker gray shade thereof. Fringe ground color, usually with a lighter base and gray medial line. Dorsal hindwing slightly brownish gray, darker and grayer on distal half, with a gray ill-defined oval discal spot and thin terminal line. Hindwing fringe light gray brown with a gray medial line. <bold>Abdomen</bold> – dark brown gray. <bold>Male genitalia</bold> – Uncus cylindrical, evenly downcurved, distal portion tapering to a fine point. Tegumen with large penicillus lobes. Juxta shield shaped, 0.75 × as high as wide, with shallow V-shaped ventral margin. Valve S-shaped, 4.5 × as long as wide (measured at mid-portion), nearly even in width except for slight constriction at base of cucullus; with stout knob-like basal saccular process extending dorsolater<!--PageBreak-->ally from base and nearly reaching base of costa, medial margin of this process with triangular mesial projection at base and concave mid-section, apex rounded. Sacculus reaching to or slightly dorsal to costal margin and extending distally to mid-valve. Clasper a smooth ridge. Ampulla short, nearly spherical.

Aedeagus tubular, 4.5 × as long as wide, with a slightly elevated patch of minute spinules on ventral distal end. Vesica 0.67 × as long as aedeagus, bent 135° toward right at base to project anteriorly and toward right, basal half bulbous and distal half tubular, adorned with several diverticula and cornuti; a broad diverticulum on subbasal ventral surface with sclerotized apex with a cocks-comb row of short spines oriented along aedeagus axis and projecting ventrad; a membranous conical apical diverticulum on posterior vesica projecting anteriorly and rightward; a solitary cornutus on medial posterior surface comprised of a proximally-angled spine arising from a button-like base; and subapically, a patch of variable-sized spine-like cornuti directed proximally. <bold>Female genitalia</bold> – Ovipositor lobe elongate, dorsoventrally flattened and curved slightly ventrad at apex, 0.33 × as wide as long at base, narrowing near base to 0.25 × length, and tapering over distal third to a blunt point; proximal segments fused ventrally and dorsally to past mid-point; covered entirely but sparsely by long fine hair-like setae. Abdominal segment VIII 2 × as wide as long, anterior apophysis 1.25 × length of segment VIII and posterior apophysis 2.25 × length of segment VIII. Ostium bursae moderately sclerotized, ventral lip smoothly rounded and projecting posteriorly to cover ostium.

                        <p><italic><tp:taxon-name>Resapamea angelika</tp:taxon-name></italic> is a distinctive <italic><tp:taxon-name>Resapamea</tp:taxon-name></italic> species due to the combination of large size, even dark red-brown forewing color, small or absent orbicular spot, and narrow reniform spot with well-demarcated thin black outline and prominent cream to light orange filling. It is most likely to be confused with <italic><tp:taxon-name>Resapamea passer</tp:taxon-name></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs 12–14</xref>) and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Resapamea innota</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Smith) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 16</xref>). <italic><tp:taxon-name>Resapamea passer</tp:taxon-name></italic> is variable, usually brown or mottled tan and brown, but is not dark red brown like <italic><tp:taxon-name>Resapamea angelika</tp:taxon-name></italic>. <italic><tp:taxon-name>Resapamea innota</tp:taxon-name></italic> has red-brown or orange-brown forewings and could potentially be confused with <italic><tp:taxon-name>Resapamea angelika</tp:taxon-name></italic> on this basis. Its orbicular spot is similar to the reniform spot, not very small or absent as in <italic><tp:taxon-name>Resapamea angelika</tp:taxon-name></italic>, and the reniform spot is broader, lacks a black outline and is filled with uniform light ochre, unlike that of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Resapamea angelika</tp:taxon-name></italic>. The dorsal hindwing of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Resapamea innota</tp:taxon-name></italic> is darker gray than in <italic><tp:taxon-name>Resapamea angelika</tp:taxon-name></italic>. <italic><tp:taxon-name>Resapamea angelika</tp:taxon-name></italic> appears to be a significantly larger moth (FW length 19 mm) compared to <italic><tp:taxon-name>Resapamea innota</tp:taxon-name></italic> (FW length 14–17 mm) .</p>

                        <p><bold>Head</bold> – Antenna of male nearly filiform with slight constriction at base of each segment, covered ventrally by short cilia. Antenna of female filiform. Eye round, naked. Labial palp covered by short flat scales on sides, elongating to form a brush-like ventral fringe. Frons smooth, covered by narrow red-brown scales. Top of head covered by long and narrow red-brown scales. <bold>Thorax</bold> – Vestiture of collar, thorax, and tegula similar, a mixture of long, narrow, apically notched red-brown-tipped tan and red-brown scales, appearing even dark red brown, weakly tufted. Legs even gray brown, with three rows of spiniform setae on basitarsus and four irregular rows on other tarsal segments. <bold>Wings</bold> – Forewing length: male 19 mm. Forewing with a mixture of red-brown and gray-brown scales, ground color appearing even dark red brown, <!--PageBreak-->minimally darker in basal, medial and terminal areas; veins brownish gray, especially along radial and cubital veins, but not contrasting. Basal line absent. Antemedial line single, dark red brown, faint, ill-defined and incomplete, most evident on costa, in cell, and in fold, slightly offset toward base on costa and nearly transversely-oriented elsewhere. Postmedial line similar but more diffuse, oriented at 45° angle to wing from near end of cell to posterior margin, obsolete near costa. Subterminal line absent, its position in paratype indicated by a faint dark spot on costa in distal subterminal area and in holotype by proximal margin of darker terminal area. Terminal line thin, black, slightly thicker between veins. Orbicular spots small, oval, very faint in holotype, partially outlined in thin black bordered internally by cream, and filled centrally with ground color in paratype. Reniform spot moderate sized, narrowly kidney shaped, posterior portion partially fused to cubital vein in holotype, extending slightly posterior to vein in paratype, partially outlined by a thin black line strongest medially and absent anteriorly, filled peripherally with light whitish cream to light orange and containing a central or medially-positioned ground-color lunule. Claviform spot small, absent in holotype specimen and a small black smudge in paratype. Fringe brown gray with gray-orange base and darker gray medial line. Dorsal hindwing light gray orange to light fuscous, minimally darker and grayer on distal half, with slightly darker gray ill-defined narrow discal spot, veins, and terminal line. Hindwing fringe pinkish red brown with a light yellow-tan base. <bold>Abdomen</bold> – medium-dark brown-gray with slight red tint, especially posteriorly. <bold>Male genitalia</bold> – Uncus cylindrical at base, evenly downcurved, distal portion slightly dorsoventrally flattened and tapering to a fine point. Tegumen with large penicillus lobes. Juxta shield shaped, 0.5 × as high as wide, with V-shaped ventral margin. Valve weakly S-shaped, 5 × as long as wide (measured at mid-portion), tapering slightly from base to neck of cucullus; clavus large, reaching base of costa, rectangular with concave medial contour and angular apex. Sacculus reaching two-thirds of distance toward costa and extending distally to mid-valve. Clasper a smooth ridge. Ampulla short, nearly spherical. Digitus a weak ridge with a weak triangular projection, partially covered by medial cucullus. Cucullus well developed with rounded apical and slightly pointed anal ends, 1.65 × as wide as mid-valve; mesial surface covered by fine setae; corona an irregular row of stout curved setae, row partially double on dorsal half. Aedeagus tubular, 4.5 × as long as wide, with granulose patch on ventral aspect at base of vesica. Vesica 0.65 × as long as aedeagus, bent 135° toward right at base to project anteriorly and toward right, basal half bulbous, distal half tubular, with several diverticula and cornuti: weakly bulging subbasal diverticulum on ventral surface with sclerotized apex with a cock’s-comb row of short spines oriented along aedeagus axis and projecting ventrad; a membranous conical apical diverticulum on ventral vesica projecting anteriorly and toward right; a medial proximally-angled spike-like cornutus arising from a button-like base; and a subapical patch of short variable-sized spine-like cornuti directed basad. <bold>Female genitalia</bold> – Not available.</p>

                        <p>This species is only known from the vicinity of Angel Lake in the East Humboldt Range of northeastern Nevada. The habitat is sedge meadows along tributaries of Angel Creek. These meadows appear to lack <italic><tp:taxon-name>Rumex</tp:taxon-name></italic> but harbor <!--PageBreak-->dense stands of an iris (<italic><tp:taxon-name>Iris</tp:taxon-name></italic> spp., <tp:taxon-name>Iridaceae</tp:taxon-name>) which might be the larval foodplant. The early stages of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Resapamea angelika</tp:taxon-name></italic> are unknown. The few known specimens have been collected during late July and early August.</p>

                        <p><italic><tp:taxon-name>Resapamea mammuthus</tp:taxon-name></italic> is unlikely to be confused with most other species of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Resapamea</tp:taxon-name></italic> in North America due to its northerly distribution and orange-tan color. It is superficially similar to <italic><tp:taxon-name>Resapamea hedeni</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Graeser) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 18</xref>), which occurs in Asia and might also occur in Alaska (see Remarks, below). The male genitalia of these species differ in the shape of the distal uncus. It is truncated in <italic><tp:taxon-name>Resapamea mammuthus</tp:taxon-name></italic> with a small T-shaped expansion at the tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 41 inset</xref>) and tapered to a point in <italic><tp:taxon-name>Resapamea hedeni</tp:taxon-name></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 42</xref>) as well as in all other North American <italic><tp:taxon-name>Resapamea</tp:taxon-name></italic> species. The vesica of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Resapamea mammuthus</tp:taxon-name></italic> differs from those of all other <italic><tp:taxon-name>Resapamea</tp:taxon-name></italic> discussed in this paper in lacking the subbasal diverticulum and medial cornuti. It differs from that of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Resapamea hedeni</tp:taxon-name></italic> in lacking a subbasal serrate (cock’s comb) cornutus.</p>

                        <p>More than a decade ago, prior to the availability of mitochondrial DNA, the senior author conducted a study of the genus <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia</tp:taxon-name></italic> Guenée focusing on the western North American species related to <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia obliqua</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Harvey), herein referred to as the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia obliqua</tp:taxon-name></italic> species-group for convenience. These moths occur over a large area spanning the Pacific Coast to the Great Plains west to east and British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan to southern California, northeastern Arizona, and northern New Mexico north to south. This study included examination of all primary types, assembling over 600 specimens from most large institutional and many private North American collections, and examination of over 60 genitalia preparations. The conclusion was that <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia intermedia</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Barnes &amp; Benjamin), known only from the holotype from Fort Calgary, is distinct but that all other populations in the species-group exhibit nearly continuous clinal variation in maculation and genitalia to form a circle of races (rasenkranz) from California, across Montana, and ending in the montane forests of the Southwest. This work was accepted for publication but <!--PageBreak-->was withdrawn because of the author’s concern that somewhat distinctive populations on the Pacific Coast and in the Southwest might be different species from the widespread intervening population but that the genitalia structure lacked differences sufficient for resolving the species.</p>
                        <p>Since then, barcodes have demonstrated a consistent 2% difference between populations from near the Pacific Coast (northern California, Washington, and British Columbia (n=6)) and those from farther inland (Colorado, Washington, Wyoming, Alberta, and British Columbia (n=7)) that along with slight differences in maculation suggest that they are best treated as distinct species. The western species is <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia obliqua</tp:taxon-name></italic> and the eastern one is <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia medialis</tp:taxon-name></italic> Smith.</p>
                        <p><italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia obliqua</tp:taxon-name></italic> occurs east to the Sierra Nevada in California and the crest of the Cascade Range in Oregon and Washington. It occurs continuously on the coast north to southwestern British Columbia, with a disjunct northern population at Terrace, British Columbia. Its forewing is warm orange brown, varying considerably in darkness from dark brown on the California Coast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 21</xref>), lighter orange brown in the Pacific Northwest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs 22–23</xref>), and pale yellow brown in the Sierra Nevada. The hindwing is pale with a yellow tint, usually with dark veins and a gray suffusion in the submarginal area. The forewing pattern is similar to that of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia medialis</tp:taxon-name></italic>, especially where they approach each other in the PNW, with slight differences that are described under <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia medialis</tp:taxon-name></italic>.</p>

                        <p><italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia medialis</tp:taxon-name></italic> is the widespread and variable species that occurs east of the range of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia obliqua</tp:taxon-name></italic>. It is similar to it in size and pattern but is duller gray brown in the PNW, ranging from very pale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 24</xref>) to darker gray brown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs 25–26</xref>). The <!--PageBreak--><!--PageBreak--><!--PageBreak-->forewing postmedial line tends to be more angled relative to the posterior margin than in <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia obliqua</tp:taxon-name></italic> and usually lacks a slight bend in or near the fold that is found commonly in that species. The hindwing ground color is variable, most commonly off-white, but lacks a yellow tint. Gray scaling on the hindwing varies from absent to covering the entire wing. When present on the distal portion, it often forms a band to the outer margin, whereas in <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia obliqua</tp:taxon-name></italic> gray shading usually leaves the outer edge of the wing pale. Specimens of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia medialis</tp:taxon-name></italic> from forests tend to be darker than those from open sage steppe habitats, especially in southern British Columbia and western Montana. Its northern limit in the PNW is at 100 Mile House in south-central British Columbia.</p>
                        <p>Specimens of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia medialis</tp:taxon-name></italic> from the Great Plains are similar to those in the PNW but tend to be more uniform with dull gray-tan color, smooth lines, and less contrast between the antemedial and medial areas on the inner third of the forewing. Populations from the southern Rocky Mountains have a similar pattern to those from the Great Plains but are more colorful and variable, with gray or red-brown individuals and paler gray-white subterminal areas. Those from Utah and Arizona are red brown, darkest in Arizona.</p>
                        <p>As mentioned under <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia obliqua</tp:taxon-name></italic>, the barcodes of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia obliqua</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia medialis</tp:taxon-name></italic> differ by 2%.A third barcode haplotype differing from both of these by slightly more than 2% exists for a single specimen of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia medialis</tp:taxon-name></italic> from Wyoming (BOLDSYSTEMS Sample ID: CNCNoctuoidea6703). This specimen is superficially indistinguishable from two other Wyoming specimens with barcodes that match those of other <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia medialis</tp:taxon-name></italic> and this haplotype is therefore interpreted as a DNA polymorphism rather than evidence of a cryptic species.</p>
                        <p>A discussion of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia intermedia</tp:taxon-name></italic>–known only from the holotype–is warranted in this section because its type locality of Fort Calgary suggests that it should be sympatric with <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia medialis</tp:taxon-name></italic> near present-day Calgary in southwestern Alberta. Its forewing is warm yellow brown unlike those of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia medialis</tp:taxon-name></italic>, with markings that are more like those of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia obliqua</tp:taxon-name></italic> than <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia medialis</tp:taxon-name></italic>. Structurally, its digitus is shorter and more bluntly rounded than those of all other populations in the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia obliqua</tp:taxon-name></italic> species-group (n=45). The following discussion regarding its type locality is contributed by B. C. Schmidt:</p>
                        <p>“<italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia intermedia</tp:taxon-name></italic> is an enigmatic taxon that has not been recorded near the stated type locality, nor anywhere else in Alberta (Pohl et al. 2010), since the collection of the type specimen about a century ago. In Barnes and McDunnough’s (1924) original description, the type specimen data is given as “Ft. Calgary, N. W. Brit. Columbia” and “VIII, 16” without a mention of year or collector. Virtually all of the moth specimens originating from the Calgary area in the early 1900’s were collected by the well-known pioneer lepidopterist Frederic Hova Wolley Dod who resided in the foothills just west of Calgary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Bird et al. 1995</xref>), and who was the source of many moths named by J. B. Smith (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Todd 1982</xref>). However, Dod’s specimens were never labelled as “Ft. Calgary” nor “N. W. Brit. Columbia” – this convention appears to have been used solely by J. Gamble Geddes, who made extensive <tp:taxon-name>Lepidoptera</tp:taxon-name> collections in south-western Alberta during his visits in 1883 and 1884 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Geddes 1889</xref>). It is not clear why Geddes referred to the region as North West British Columbia, as the modern bound<!--PageBreak--><!--PageBreak-->aries of British Columbia were already established at that time, while southern Alberta was known as the district of Alberta and was part of the North West Territories. A subsequent note on his collecting again shows that he referred to the region as British Columbia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Geddes 1889</xref>), possibly because he considered the mountains and passes he visited to be part of B.C. (the passes indeed straddling the Alberta – B.C. boundary). Several butterflies (<italic><tp:taxon-name>Lycaena dorcas florus</tp:taxon-name></italic> W. H. Edwards, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Colias elis</tp:taxon-name></italic> Strecker) and moths collected by Geddes during these trips were named as new species. Geddes’ handwritten catalogue of butterflies in the CNC Entomology Library indicates that Geddes collected butterflies in the Crowsnest Pass area in August of 1883, and was collecting in the Crowsnest Pass proper on August 16<sup>th</sup>, corresponding to the “VIII 16” of the <italic>intermedia</italic> holotype. As there was no direct rail line between the Crowsnest Pass and Calgary, some 350 km distant, it is very unlikely that the <italic>intermedia</italic> type could have been collected on the same day in Calgary, and it appears that Geddes simply recorded the nearest major settlement before distributing the specimens and associated label data. A week earlier, Geddes collected the type specimens of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Lycaena dorcas florus</tp:taxon-name></italic> (W. H. Edwards) at “Garnett’s Ranche” near Lundbreck at the mouth of the Crowsnest Pass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Bird and Ferris 1979</xref>). As Geddes visited and likely also stayed at Garnett’s Ranch, which served as a base for geology field parties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Inglis 1978</xref>), Geddes undoubtedly also collected moths at the ranch. The type locality of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Gortyna intermedia</tp:taxon-name></italic> Barnes &amp; Benjamin is therefore restricted to Lundbreck, Municipality of Crowsnest Pass, Alberta. The diverse montane fauna of southwestern Alberta continues to yield previously undocumented moth species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Schmidt 2007</xref>), and the persistence of an undiscovered population of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia intermedia</tp:taxon-name></italic> is certainly possible.”</p>
                        <p>The holotype of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia intermedia</tp:taxon-name></italic> resembles the single specimen of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia obliqua</tp:taxon-name></italic> in the CNC from Terrace in west-central British Columbia. This locality is far north of the continuous distribution of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia obliqua</tp:taxon-name></italic>, which ends near Vancouver, British Columbia. This specimen is structurally similar to other <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia obliqua</tp:taxon-name></italic> populations, not <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia intermedia</tp:taxon-name></italic>. All British Columbia <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia obliqua</tp:taxon-name></italic> species-group specimens from east of the Cascade Mountains and British Columbia Coast Ranges are typical <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia medialis</tp:taxon-name></italic>, including from Cranbrook which is the closest locality to the Crowsnest Pass locality of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia intermedia</tp:taxon-name></italic>. Nonetheless, it is interesting to speculate that <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia intermedia</tp:taxon-name></italic> could be an eastern population of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia obliqua</tp:taxon-name></italic>. We retain <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia intermedia</tp:taxon-name></italic> as a species because of the structural differences between it and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia obliqua</tp:taxon-name></italic>, and because there are no records of similar specimens in central British Columbia between Terrace and Crowsnest Pass.</p>
                        <p>Although the present reduction of this species-group to three species–<italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia intermedia</tp:taxon-name></italic>, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia medialis</tp:taxon-name></italic>, and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia obliqua</tp:taxon-name></italic>–is best supported by the available data there are two remaining issues that cannot be solved with the information at hand. A large series of specimens from the east slope of the Cascades at Camp Sherman, Jefferson County, Oregon at OSAC show possible intergradation between <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia obliqua</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia medialis</tp:taxon-name></italic>, with some specimens that are difficult to assign to either species. This raises the possibility that the original hypothesis that <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia obliqua</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia medialis</tp:taxon-name></italic> are the same species could be correct despite the different barcodes in coastal and interior populations. Barcode or other DNA data from this population might help to elucidate its significance but is not available.</p>
                        <p><!--PageBreak-->Similarly in the Southwest, at the other end of the rasenkranz, more DNA samples from Colorado, Utah, and Arizona would be helpful to exclude the presence of an undiscovered species amongst the colorful populations that occur there. Of these, a dusky red-brown population from east-central Arizona is the most distinctive.</p>

                        <p>Subspecies <italic>orca</italic> is larger than other populations of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Xestia perquiritata</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Morrison). It is the only subspecies in which the wing is uniform black with unmarked white filling of the lines and spots. The western mountain subspecies <italic><tp:taxon-name>Xestia perquiritata partita</tp:taxon-name></italic> (McDunnough) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 31</xref>) has occasional melanic specimens. These are smaller than <italic><tp:taxon-name>Xestia perquiritata orca</tp:taxon-name></italic> (forewing length 16–20 mm for subspecies <italic>partita</italic>; 21–23 mm for <italic><tp:taxon-name>Xestia perquiritata orca</tp:taxon-name></italic>) and differ in having light gray forewing lines and spots as well as darker gray scales in the central reniform spot. These markings are pure white or cream in subspecies <italic>orca</italic>.</p>
                        <p>The valve of the male genitalia of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Xestia perquiritata orca</tp:taxon-name></italic> is more massive than that of subspecies <italic>partita</italic>, reflecting the larger size of the moth.

                        <p><bold>Head</bold> – Antenna of male beadlike with short anterior and posterior fasciculations. Antenna of female filiform. Scape with black and white scales, predominantly black dorsally and white ventrally. Eye rounded, smooth. Labial palp covered in gray and blackish-gray scales, scales short on sides and lengthening to a ventral fringe on first two segments. Frons smooth, covered by thin scales that are white centrally and black on sides of head. Top of head covered by thin black scales with scattered white scales in midline and on posterior aspect. <bold>Thorax</bold> – Vestiture of weakly spatulate white-tipped <!--PageBreak-->black and scattered white scales, appearing black. Prothoracic collar black with pale-gray edge. Tegula covered by black scales. Legs covered by dark-gray scales with a white ring on each distal segment; medial tibia with a loose row of spiniform setae; ventral tarsal segments with three rows of spiniform setae. <bold>Wings</bold> – Forewing length of males 21–23 mm; females 22 mm. Forewing ground color nearly even brownish black; darkest black in basal area posterior to cubital vein, in fold in medial area, opposite cell and in fold in subterminal area, and between veins in subterminal area; palest whitish gray anterior to cubital vein across antemedial area; slightly mottled with smudged darker veins in terminal area. Basal, antemedial, and postmedial lines similar, black, double, with nearly white pale-cream filling; mostly evident as filling because of dark ground. Basal line pale filling fused to adjacent pale anterior antemedial area. Antemedial line strongly excurved with apex at base of claviform spot, drawn toward base on veins. Medial line absent. Postmedial line toothed on veins; sharply displaced toward base on costa to top of reniform spot, nearly straight from below costa to M3, then angled toward base and slightly curved to meet posterior margin at nearly a right angle. Subterminal line pale gray near costa and evident elsewhere as a transition between black in subterminal area and slightly lighter terminal area. Terminal line a series of black spots between veins. Orbicular and reniform spots completely filled with light cream, often fused. Orbicular spot irregularly ovoid. Reniform spot sideways heart shaped with a deep lateral indentation. Fringe dark gray, weakly scalloped with black. Dorsal hindwing sooty dark gray, faintly brown tinted in some specimens, with faintly darker thin discal spot, postmedial line, veins, and thin terminal line. Hindwing fringe light gray with darker base. <bold>Abdomen</bold> – Blackish gray, slightly lighter than thorax. <bold>Male genitalia</bold> – Uncus strap-like, dorso-ventrally flattened with a spatulate tip. Tegumen with weak penicillus lobes. Juxta broad, 1.8 × as wide as long, with straight transverse ventral margin and bilobed dorsal margin with a slight notch at base of aedeagus. Valve elongate, 4.5 × as long as wide, with slightly undulating costal and ventral margins, tapering to a point distal point with additional small projection from subapical ventral margin and an elongate pollex typical of genus <italic><tp:taxon-name>Xestia</tp:taxon-name></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Lafontaine 1998</xref>). Sacculus moderate, expanded to reach costal margin at base of valve and tapering distally to end at mid-valve. Clasper shark-fin shaped, oriented slightly mesially at origin and curved nearly 90° laterally to project dorsolaterally with tip slightly dorsal to costa. Digitus weak, broadly triangular. Apex of valve as described above without an expanded cucullus or corona. Aedeagus long and tubular, 8 × as long as wide, gradually widening from mid-shaft to apex, bearing patches of fine spinules on left side of mid-portion and on right side of apex. Vesica a simple membranous tube, 0.8 × as long as aedeagus and 0.3 × as wide as long; basilar vesica recurved 180° dorsad and rightward so that mid-vesica projects toward base of aedeagus and distal portion curved additional 45° leftward to overlap aedeagus. <bold>Female genitalia</bold> – Not examined.</p>

                        <p>This moth is restricted to the immediate Pacific Coast of Oregon and Washington, usually within several hundred meters of the shore. It has been collected from the vicinity of Newport on the central Oregon coast north to Neah Bay on the northwest tip of the Olympic Peninsula in Washington. Subspecies <italic><tp:taxon-name>Xestia perquiritata orca</tp:taxon-name></italic> flies during late July and August. The food plant is unknown, but other subspecies <!--PageBreak-->of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Xestia perquiritata</tp:taxon-name></italic> have been reared from conifers in the family <tp:taxon-name>Pinaceae</tp:taxon-name>, particularly firs (<italic><tp:taxon-name>Abies</tp:taxon-name></italic> spp.) and spruces (<italic><tp:taxon-name>Picea</tp:taxon-name></italic> spp.) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Lafontaine 1998</xref>). Based on the composition of the forests where <italic><tp:taxon-name>Xestia perquiritata orca</tp:taxon-name></italic> occurs the most likely food plant is Sitka spruce (<italic><tp:taxon-name>Picea sitchensis</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Bong.) Carr.), although grand fir (<italic><tp:taxon-name>Abies grandis</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Dougl.) Forbes) is possible.</p>

                        <p>The genus <italic><tp:taxon-name>Xestia</tp:taxon-name></italic> was revised for North America by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Lafontaine (1998)</xref>. He considered a specimen in the CNC from Newport, Oregon to be a melanic <italic><tp:taxon-name>Xestia perquiritata partita</tp:taxon-name></italic> (McDunnough), the western North American subspecies of this boreal and montane moth. At the time, the coast population was only known from a few specimens from this locality and only one of these was at the CNC. It is now apparent that distinct coastal populations of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Xestia perquiritata</tp:taxon-name></italic> have a range that extends at least as far north as the Olympic Peninsula and are nearly uniform in appearance. This subspecies might have a wider distribution on the coasts of northwestern California, British Columbia, and Alaska.</p>

            <p>The taxonomic changes and new taxa descriptions in this paper are part of an ongoing effort to understand fully the macromoth fauna of the PNW. Once published, these changes will be added to the website Pacific Northwest Moths (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pnwmoths.biol.wwu.edu/">http://pnwmoths.biol.wwu.edu/</ext-link> ).</p>
            <p>Although the focus of this work is regional, the genera <italic><tp:taxon-name>Resapamea</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia</tp:taxon-name></italic> in the tribe <tp:taxon-name>Apameini</tp:taxon-name> of the <tp:taxon-name>Noctuidae</tp:taxon-name> are partially revised herein. This piecemeal ap<!--PageBreak-->proach may be less optimal than an all-encompassing generic revision, however, there are at present barriers that preclude satisfactory completion of such a study in both genera. <italic><tp:taxon-name>Resapamea</tp:taxon-name></italic> and thespecies in the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia obliqua</tp:taxon-name></italic> species-group are similar in that structural differences between species are slight (e. g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs 38–41</xref>). Therefore, other distinguishing features such as differences in biology or DNA sequences, like barcodes, assume greater importance for defining species boundaries. The most readily available DNA sequencing techniques require recently collected material, preferably less than ten years old. Most North American museum material is significantly older than this and fresher material is not currently available for these species from areas that are likely to be critical to solving the remaining quandaries. Collectors are encouraged to seek out and submit specimens for DNA sequencing of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia</tp:taxon-name></italic> from the east slope of the Cascades in Oregon and the Southwest, and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Resapamea innota</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Resapamea enargia</tp:taxon-name></italic> from any part of the western United States. Any <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia</tp:taxon-name></italic> specimens from central British Columbia or near the border of Alberta and British Columbia might shed light on the relationship of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia intermedia</tp:taxon-name></italic> to <italic><tp:taxon-name>Hydraecia obliqua</tp:taxon-name></italic>.</p>
