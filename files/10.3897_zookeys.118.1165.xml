            <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Clytine beetles of the genus <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus</tp:taxon-name></italic> Ohbayashi, 1964, are easily recognized at first observation by the small, black and glossy body with the ordinary arrangement of white pubescent maculation on the elytra. The genus is distinguishable from related <!--PageBreak-->genera, like <italic><tp:taxon-name>Rhaphuma</tp:taxon-name></italic> Pascoe, by rather widely separated antennal insertions, long, erect, pale hairs on the middle and hind tibiae, and also by the peculiar structure of the male endophallus. Up to the present time, a total of seven taxa, including one subspecies, have been recorded from a rather restricted area between the Ryukyu Islands of Southwest Japan and northern <tp:taxon-name>Indochina</tp:taxon-name>. They are <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus nobuoi nobuoi</tp:taxon-name></italic> Ohbayashi, 1964, from Amami Isls., Japan, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus nobuoi akusekianus</tp:taxon-name></italic> Niisato, 2005, from Tokara Isls., Japan, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus hirtipes</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Matsushita, 1940), from Taiwan, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus subnitidus</tp:taxon-name></italic> Holzschuh, 1985, from Taiwan, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus dembickyi</tp:taxon-name></italic> Holzschuh, 1991, from North Vietnam, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus squamifer</tp:taxon-name></italic> Holzschuh, 1991, and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus setosulus</tp:taxon-name></italic> Holzschuh, 1991, from Northwest Thailand.
            </p>
            <p>In spite of Taiwan’s rich longicorn beetles fauna, only two species of this genus, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus hirtipes</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus subnitidus</tp:taxon-name></italic>, were known from there. The first author preliminarily examined the Taiwanese <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus</tp:taxon-name></italic> species more than a quarter century ago, and presented an oral report at the annual meeting of the Japanese Society of Coleopterology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Niisato 1983</xref>). According to his provisional report, a total of six species in the genus were recognized from Taiwan, of which five were unnamed species.
            </p>
            <p>In this study, we basically follow the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Niisato (1983)</xref>, and carefully describe or redescribe the members of the genus from Taiwan and the Ryukyu Islands considering details of external morphology and male and female genitalia. We also discuss the systematic position of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus</tp:taxon-name></italic> in the tribe <tp:taxon-name>Clytini</tp:taxon-name>.

            <title>Historical review</title>
            <p>The genus <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus</tp:taxon-name></italic> Ohbayashi, 1964, was established for <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus nobuoi</tp:taxon-name></italic> Ohbayashi from Amami-Ôshima Is., Southwest Japan. Later, this type species was synonymized with the Taiwanese species, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Rhaphuma hirtipes</tp:taxon-name></italic> Matsushita, 1940, by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Kojima et al. (1965)</xref>. They also re-affirmed the validity of the genus <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus</tp:taxon-name></italic> and placed it under <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus</tp:taxon-name></italic> as <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus hirtipes</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Matsushita, 1940). According to their paper, this action was made by comparison with specimens determined as <italic><tp:taxon-name>Rhaphuma hirtipes</tp:taxon-name></italic> by the late Dr. M. Hayashi from his collection. Later, Kusama and Takakuwa (1984) restored <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus nobuoi</tp:taxon-name></italic> as a valid species. However, they never examined the true <italic><tp:taxon-name>Rhaphuma hirtipes</tp:taxon-name></italic>, and confused several different species in the genus with it. So at least as of that time, it was uncertain whether <italic><tp:taxon-name>Rhaphuma hirtipes</tp:taxon-name></italic> should be transferred to the genus <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus</tp:taxon-name></italic> or not.
            </p>
            <p>The holotype of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Rhaphuma hirtipes</tp:taxon-name></italic> was assumed to be deposited in an institution somewhere in Berlin, or lost during the war. However, the first author discovered the holotype of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Rhaphuma hirtipes</tp:taxon-name></italic> in the general collection of the Hokkaido University. By examination of this type specimen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Niisato (1983)</xref> accepted the placement in the genus <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus</tp:taxon-name></italic>, and recognized six species in the genus, of which five needed to be described as new taxa for the Taiwanese fauna. After Niisato’s presentation, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus subnitidus</tp:taxon-name></italic> Holzschuh, 1984, was described from Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Until now, four taxa in this genus from Taiwan have remained undescribed.
            </p>
            <p>Based on our recent examination of the late Dr. Masao Hayashi’s collection deposited in the Natural History Museum of Osaka, we only located a single species, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus subnitidus</tp:taxon-name></italic>, in his collection. This indicates that the previously incorrect action by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Kojima et al. (1965)</xref> was due to the misidentification of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus subnitidus</tp:taxon-name></italic> with <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus hirtipes</tp:taxon-name></italic>. Succeeding authors of the picture books of Taiwanese <tp:taxon-name>Cerambycidae</tp:taxon-name> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Yu and Nara 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Yu et al. 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Hua et al. 2009</xref>) inherited this mistake.

                    <p>Small to very small clytine with black, glossy body arranged with white pubescent maculations on pronotum, elytra and ventral surface, characterized by relatively well-separated eyes, and dense hair on middle and hind tibiae. Colour mostly black, glossy, sometimes more or less matted, usually with brownish antennae and legs, and sometimes also on meso- and metathoraces, and abdomen. Hairs and pubescence mostly very short though some partially dense and long; head usually sparsely clothed with pale gray pubescence on frons in both sexes, though more or less sparsely so in ♀; antennae with long, pale brown hairs along underside of 2nd to 4th or 5th segments; pronotum thinly pubescent, with white pubescent band along base (<italic>Pb</italic>), transverse or separated at sides, though sometimes sparse or quite absent according to species; scutellum with fine pale pubescence; elytra basically with three white maculations: 1) semicircular maculation or slightly oblique short band on basal third to fourth (<italic>La</italic>), 2) almost complete arcuate band on apical third to 2/5 (<italic>Lp</italic>), 3) narrow but usually clear band at apices (<italic>A</italic>), supplemented with the following maculation according to species: 4) basal narrow band (<italic>B</italic>), 5) sutural spot behind scutellum (<italic>S</italic>); prosternum with white pubescence on basal half to 2/3; metasternum with white pubescence at sides (<italic>Msl</italic>) and on intercoxal process (<italic>Mss</italic>); metathorax with L-shaped band along apical margin of metasternum, extending to apical half to 2/3 of metepisternum (<italic>Mta</italic>); abdomen with white pubescence at sides of ventrites 1–2, sometimes with same, though sparse maculation on ventrite 3 or ventrites 3–4 (<italic>V1</italic>–<italic>V4</italic>).

Tegmen usually elongate, shorter than median lobe; parameres nearly half to 2/5 the length of tegmen, divided in apical fifth to third, with each lobe almost rounded at apex, which is provided with short and long setae; basal ridge raised. Eighth tergite more or less elongate, slightly longer than wide. Eighth sternite distinctly transverse, emarginate or transversely truncate at apical margin, provided with long projection at middle of basal margin.

                    <p>The species of the genus <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus</tp:taxon-name></italic> Ohbayashi have so far been known from a rather restricted area between Indochina and the Ryukyu Islands of Southwest Japan. However, several undetermined species belonging to the genus have been found from Sumatra, Borneo and the Malay Peninsula. The genus contains small, glossy black species with pure white pubescent maculations on the body surface, and are slightly similar in external appearance to several members of the genus <italic><tp:taxon-name>Rhaphuma</tp:taxon-name></italic> Pascoe. They share the following features: 1) body relatively elongate, especially in elytra, meso- and metasterna, and legs; 2) antennae thin and long, with 3rd segment usually longer than scape; 3) antennal cavities approximate each other; 3) eyes large and prominent, rather distinctly approximate in front; 4) mandible almost smooth and provided with numerous short hairs along inner margin; 5) labial and <!--PageBreak-->maxillary palpi show distinct sexual dimorphism in each terminal segment, strongly dilated apicad in ♂ or weakly so in ♀. However, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus</tp:taxon-name></italic> is very distinct in the tribe <tp:taxon-name>Clytini</tp:taxon-name> by a combination of the following characters: 1) body small and rather convex, with relatively long antennae and legs; 2) colour wholly black, usually brownish antennae and legs, strongly glossy or sometimes more or less matted; 3) white scaly pubescence form the maculations on elytra, ventral surface and sometimes on the base of pronotum, of which elytra are always provided with three arcuate or transverse bands, sometimes supplemented with vague basal band along basal margin and a longitudinal spot near suture behind scutellum; 4) mid and hind tibiae provided with long erect hairs; 5) frons relatively wide, with a fine median groove; antennae usually thickened towards apical segments, though simply slender in <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus hirtipes</tp:taxon-name></italic>, with antennal cavities widely separated at sides of frons; 6) pronotum rather convex, simply arcuate at sides; 7) male genitalia relatively large, with endophallus densely provided with minute serrate or crenulate spicules on apical part, without spinous spicules.
                    </p>
                    <p>Adults of the genus are usually found on various types of tree blossoms as <italic><tp:taxon-name>Castanopsis</tp:taxon-name></italic>, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Quercus</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Acer</tp:taxon-name></italic> mainly in spring and early summer season, such as February to June, except for <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus hirtipes</tp:taxon-name></italic> which appears in the autumn season. Larvae of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus nobuoi</tp:taxon-name></italic>, bore in the dead, thin twigs of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Machilus thunbergii</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Rhaphiolepis indica</tp:taxon-name></italic> var. <italic>umbellata</italic> (Niisato, 2007).

                  <p>The nominotypical subspecies of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus nobuoi</tp:taxon-name></italic> Ohbayashi is endemic to the Amami-Ôshima Isls., mid-Ryukyus of Southwest Japan. The adult beetles mainly<!--PageBreak--> appear in summer between mid June and early July, and are often found on tree blossoms. The larvae bore in freshly dead twigs of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Rhaphiolepis indica</tp:taxon-name></italic> var. <italic>umbellata</italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Machilus thunbergii</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Niisato, 2007). Though not so rare until 1970’s, only a few specimens of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus nobuoi nobuoi</tp:taxon-name></italic> have been collected since the 1980’s. This clytine has been recently treated as “Data Deficient”, a category of endangered animals in the Japanese Red Data Book (Ministry of the Environment, Japan, 2007).
                    </p>
                    <p>This species is somewhat similar in external morphology to <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus setiger</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n. from Taiwan, but can be easily distinguished from the latter by the elytra lacking erect long pale hairs and quite different structure of the male genitalia.

These two species are also easily distinguished by the male genitalia. This species has the elongate median struts which are about 7/10 the length of the median lobe, and has a rather strongly expanded base of the ring part of the tegmen.

                    <p>The population from Bilyu, Xiulin Township in east-central part of the central mountains of Taiwan, shows a slight colour variation in antennae and legs which are clearly pale brown, but other characteristics agree quite well with the populations from other localities.</p>
                    <p>This is the most common species from the genus in Taiwan, and widely recorded from various localities north to south on the island. The adult beetles appear from early spring to early summer (March to June), and visit various tree blossoms.</p>

                    <p><italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus setiger</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n. is a distinctive species in having a very glossy body with erect, long, pale hairs especially on the elytral surface, and easily distinguished from the other members of the Taiwanese <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus</tp:taxon-name></italic>. Concerning the morphology of male genitalia, this new species and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus subnitidus</tp:taxon-name></italic> Holzschuhshare several structures such as the distinctly long median struts, the ratio of the length between parameres and tegmen which is nearly half in length, similar forms of abdominal segment 8, and the similar pattern of spinous spicules behind crescent-like spicules on the endophallus. In female genitalia, the two species also have similar structure as shown in the above description. Therefore, these two species seem to form a species-group among the Taiwanese members of the genus.

                    <p>This new species mainly appears in the summer season since most of the type series were collected in July, except for several paratypes collected in April and May.</p>

                    <p>In having the matted body with similar pattern of white pubescent maculation on the elytra, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus nubilus</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n. is somewhat similar to <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus juni</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus yulongi</tp:taxon-name></italic> spp. n. which will be subsequently described, but is clearly distinguished from these two congeners by the relatively elongate pronotum with white pubescent maculation along the basal margin. Considering the male genitalia, this new species has some relationship with <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus subnitidus</tp:taxon-name></italic> Holzschuh and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus setiger</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n., but is clearly separable from them by markedly broadened median lobe and rather narrow ring parts of tegmen. Besides, it is very unique that this new species and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus hirtipes</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Matsushita), comb. n. share an uncoiled duct in spermatheca of female genitalia in spite of strongly coiled ones in the other five species from Japan and Taiwan. The true affinity of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus nubilus</tp:taxon-name></italic> is uncertain since the morphological convergence is recognized in both external and genitalic features between some sympatric species of the genus. It may be possible to consider that <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus nubilus</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n. has the closest relationship with <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus hirtipes</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Matsushita), comb. n. by their uncoiled duct of spermatheca.

                    <p><italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus nubilus</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n. is widespread over the entire island of Taiwan and is rather common among the Taiwanese members of the genus. Adult beetles are usually found on various kinds of tree blossoms in the spring season mainly from March to April.

                    <p><italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus yulongi</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n. is closely related in the external and genitalic morphology to <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus juni</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n., but it can be distinguished from the latter by strongly glossy body, more coarsely punctured pronotum, sparse white pubescence on elytral bases, dense minute spinous spicules on the endophallus, gently arcuate apical margin of 8th tergite and not so strongly constricted basal part of bursa copratrix.
                    </p>
                    <p>This new species is rather rare among the Taiwanese members of the genus, and sometimes found on the blossoms of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Castanopsis</tp:taxon-name></italic> and the other tree blossoms.
                    </p>
                    <p>Four female paratypes show very peculiar variation in colour and pubescence as follows: 1) Body black with weak bluish tinge; 2) pronotum, elytra and ventral surface rather densely clothed with pale gray pubescence; 3) <italic>S</italic> and <italic>La</italic> completely joining; 3) <italic>Lp</italic> very wide, almost 4 times as wide as that of normal individuals, completely attaining both external and sutural margins; 4) <italic>A</italic> very wide, almost twice in width to that of normal individuals. These questionable specimens are completely consistent in both external and genitalic morphologies with the type series of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus  yulongi</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n. in spite of the peculiar external appearance.

                    <p>This clytine beetle is formally treated here as a member of the genus <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus</tp:taxon-name></italic> Ohbayashi. As was written in “Historical review” on the earlier page, this species was first described under the genus <italic><tp:taxon-name>Rhaphuma</tp:taxon-name></italic> Pascoe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Matsushita 1940</xref>), and later was transferred to <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus</tp:taxon-name></italic> by misidentification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Kojima et al. 1965</xref>). The previous authors, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Kojima et al. (1965)</xref>, had never examined the holotype of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Rhaphuma hirtipes</tp:taxon-name></italic>, and confused it as the senior synonym of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus nobuoi</tp:taxon-name></italic> Ohbayashi. We carefully examined the holotype specimen of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Rhaphuma hirtipes</tp:taxon-name></italic> deposited in the Hokkaido University Museum, Sapporo, and recognized it as actually a member of the genus <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus</tp:taxon-name></italic>.
                    </p>
                    <p><italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus hirtipes</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Matsushita, 1940), comb. n. is easily distinguished in external appearance from the other Taiwanese members of the genus. This species has a more elongate body on average, with the elytra nearly or more than three times as long as wide, and the very long slender antennae attaining the apical third of elytra in male or apical half in female, with less thickened middle segments and a distinctly elongate terminal segment, especially in male. From the sparse arrangement of white pubescence near base of pronotum, this species is easily separable from several similar species which has the distinct white pubescent maculation so called “<italic>Pb</italic>”. Concerning the morphology of male genitalia, this species is basically similar to those of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus nobuoi</tp:taxon-name></italic> Ohbayashi, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus subnitidus</tp:taxon-name></italic> Holzschuh and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus setiger</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n. in spite of its unique external morphology.
                    </p>
                    <p>It is very interesting that the adults of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus hirtipes</tp:taxon-name></italic> mainly appear in the autumn season in September and October, and have never been found in springtime as is the case with all of the other members of the genus. The species is not so rare in this season, and usually found on tree blossoms. However two exceptional records are known; one male collected in mid July from Dalu Forest Road in northern Taiwan; the holotype male collected in February in central Taiwan.<!--PageBreak--><!--PageBreak-->

            <p>In spite of its uniqueness, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus</tp:taxon-name></italic> Ohbayashi shows relationship in external morphology with the genera <italic><tp:taxon-name>Rhaphuma</tp:taxon-name></italic> Pascoe, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Chlorophorus</tp:taxon-name></italic> Chevrolat and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Demonax</tp:taxon-name></italic> Thomson as follows: 1) body including legs and antennae usually elongate; 2) antennae thin and long, almost exceeding apical halves of elytra in male, with segment 3 longer than scape; 3) eyes large and approximate to each other; 4) genae relatively shallow in frontal view; 5) mandible along inner margin smooth; 5) labial and maxillary palpi has a distinct sexual dimorphism in each terminal segment.

            <p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">Han and Niisato (2009)</xref> suggested that the structure of endophallus in male genitalia is one of the important characters to distinguish the genera of the tribe <tp:taxon-name>Clytini</tp:taxon-name>. <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus</tp:taxon-name></italic> is clearly defined by this character and distinguishable from the other genera of the tribe, though it has a close relationship with the genera <italic><tp:taxon-name>Rhaphuma</tp:taxon-name></italic>, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Chlorophorus</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Demonax</tp:taxon-name></italic>. These three related genera show the following features on the spicules of their endophallus; 1) <italic><tp:taxon-name>Rhaphuma</tp:taxon-name></italic>: usually without any spicules near base of endophallus, or weakly, rather sparsely provided with several kinds of spicules on the whole of endophallus; 2) <italic><tp:taxon-name>Chlorophorus</tp:taxon-name></italic>: densely provided with large-sized sclerotized spicules on the whole of endophallus; 3) <italic><tp:taxon-name>Demonax</tp:taxon-name></italic>: basically similar to those of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus</tp:taxon-name></italic>, though has a pair of sclerotized lines consisting of minute or medium-sized spinous spicules on the apical part of endophallus.
            </p>
            <p>A total of seven species of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus</tp:taxon-name></italic> from Taiwan and the Ryukyu Islands of Southwest Japan are provisionally divided into four morphological groups mainly based on both the male and female genitalia as follows.
            </p>
            <p>Group I: <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus subnitidus</tp:taxon-name></italic> Holzschuh, 1984, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus setiger</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n. and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus nobuoi  nobuoi</tp:taxon-name></italic> Ohbayashi, 1964, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus nobuoi akusekianus</tp:taxon-name></italic> Niisato, 2005.
            </p>
            <p>Group II: <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus nubilus</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n.
            </p>
            <p>Group III: <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus juni</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n. and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus yulongi</tp:taxon-name></italic> sp. n.
            </p>
            <p>Group IV: <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus hirtipes</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Matsushita, 1940), comb. n.
            </p>
          <p>Group I is recognized by small, slightly elongate, glossy (usually strongly) body with sparsely or thinly pubescent elytra, and is provisionally composed of three species. The members of this group share the following features in male genitalia:- the long median struts which are 3/5 to 7/10 the length of median lobe, as well as the long parameres which are half the length of tegmen. In female genitalia, they share the distinctly short coxite lobes which are almost equal to the length of stylus, and strongly wholly coiled spermathecal duct in the whole length. <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus nobuoi</tp:taxon-name></italic> is provisionally placed in this group and basically identical in the above characters with <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus subnitidus</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus setiger</tp:taxon-name></italic>. However, the male genitalia are rather distinctly shortened and similar to those of <italic>Amamiclytus hirtipes</italic> (Group IV), <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus juni</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus yulongi</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Group III). Besides, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus nobuoi</tp:taxon-name></italic> is provided with a sutural spot on elytra behind scutellum (“<italic>S</italic>”) which is absent in <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus subnitidus</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus setiger</tp:taxon-name></italic>.
            </p>
            <p>Group II is composed of a single species, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus nubilus</tp:taxon-name></italic>, characterized by matted, rather elongate body with dense pubescence on the elytra, and somewhat similar in <!--PageBreak-->general appearance to <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus hirtipes</tp:taxon-name></italic> except for the presence of a distinct basal band on pronotum (“<italic>Pb</italic>”) and the absence of basal bands near elytral bases (“<italic>B</italic>”). Spermatheca of female genitalia is strongly arcuate, with simple, not coiled duct. Also, the male genitalia are basically similar in the proportion of median struts and parameres to the Group I, though the median lobe is not so elongate and the ring part of tegmen is not expanded apicad as in those of Group I.
            </p>
            <p>Group III composed of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus juni</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus yulongi</tp:taxon-name></italic>, is characterized by short, broadened and matted body, rather transverse pronotum with distinctly arcuate sides, without white pubescence near the basal margin. The independence of this group is strongly supported by the structures of both male and female genitalia. In the female genitalia, the coxite lobes are long, about twice the length of stylus, spermathecal duct is strongly coiled in apical third, and bursa copulatrix is very large. It has the shortened male genitalia, of which the median struts are half the length of median lobe, and the parameres are 2/5 the length of tegmen.
            </p>
            <p>Group IV is also monotypic at least in the present sense, composed of a single species, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus hirtipes</tp:taxon-name></italic>, and is clearly distinguished from the other groups of the genus by very large and slender body on average, with sparse “<italic>Pb</italic>” on the pronotum and without “<italic>B</italic>” on the elytra. However, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus hirtipes</tp:taxon-name></italic> has close relationship in female genitalia with <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus nubilus</tp:taxon-name></italic>; spermatheca is strongly curved near middle, with gland attached at the middle of spermatheca, and the duct is not coiled, only weakly sinuate throughout. Male genitalia of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus hirtipes</tp:taxon-name></italic> are also similar to those of <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus nobuoi</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Group I), and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus juni</tp:taxon-name></italic> and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Amamiclytus yulongi</tp:taxon-name></italic> (Group III).
