                <p>Two of three species previously classified in <tp:taxon-name>Calosota</tp:taxon-name> Curtis (<tp:taxon-name>Hymenoptera</tp:taxon-name>: <tp:taxon-name>Eupelmidae</tp:taxon-name>) from the Neotropical region are transferred to <tp:taxon-name>Eupelminae</tp:taxon-name>. <tp:taxon-name>Calosota eneubulus</tp:taxon-name> (Walker) from Galapagos Islands is transferred to <tp:taxon-name>Eupelmus</tp:taxon-name> Dalman as <tp:taxon-name>Eupelmus (Eupelmus) eneubulus</tp:taxon-name> (Walker), comb. n., and <tp:taxon-name>Calosota silvai</tp:taxon-name> (Brèthes) from Chile is transferred to <tp:taxon-name>Brasema</tp:taxon-name> Cameron as <tp:taxon-name>Brasema silvai</tp:taxon-name> comb. n. <tp:taxon-name>Calosota cecidobius</tp:taxon-name> (Kieffer) from Argentina is retained in <tp:taxon-name>Calosota</tp:taxon-name>, with reservation, as an unrecognized species. The species of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota</tp:taxon-name> from the New World excluding South America are revised. Eleven species are recognized, including the seven newly described species <tp:taxon-name>Calosota albipalpus</tp:taxon-name> sp. n. (Costa Rica, Mexico, USA, Venezuela), <tp:taxon-name>Calosota bicolorata</tp:taxon-name> sp. n. (USA), <tp:taxon-name>Calosota elongata</tp:taxon-name> sp. n. (USA), <tp:taxon-name>Calosota longivena</tp:taxon-name> sp. n. (USA), <tp:taxon-name>Calosota panamaensis</tp:taxon-name> sp. n. (Panama), <tp:taxon-name>Calosota setosa</tp:taxon-name> sp. n. (Bahamas, Dominican Republic, USA), and <tp:taxon-name>Calosota speculifrons</tp:taxon-name> sp. n. (Costa Rica, USA). The 11 regional species and the Palaearctic species <tp:taxon-name>Calosota vernalis</tp:taxon-name> Curtis are keyed and illustrated. <tp:taxon-name>Calosota vernalis</tp:taxon-name> is not known to occur in the New World but is included in the key and diagnosed because it has been intercepted in quarantine in Canada. <tp:taxon-name>Calosota pseudotsugae</tp:taxon-name> Burks is placed in synonymy under <tp:taxon-name>Calosota acron</tp:taxon-name> (Walker), syn. n.,and <tp:taxon-name>Calosota kentra</tp:taxon-name> Burks, <tp:taxon-name>Calosota montana</tp:taxon-name> Burks and <tp:taxon-name>Calosota septentrionalis</tp:taxon-name> Hedqvist are placed in synonymy under <tp:taxon-name>Calosota aestivalis</tp:taxon-name> Curtis syn. n. <tp:taxon-name>Calosota modesta</tp:taxon-name> Bolívar y Pieltain is removed from synonymy under <tp:taxon-name>Calosota viridis</tp:taxon-name> Masi, stat. <!--PageBreak-->rev., and <tp:taxon-name>Calosota viridis</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Calosota matritensis</tp:taxon-name> Bolívar y Pieltain, and <tp:taxon-name>Calosota coerulea</tp:taxon-name> Nikol’skaya are placed in synonymy under <tp:taxon-name>Calosota metallica</tp:taxon-name> (Gahan), syn. n. <tp:taxon-name>Calosota grylli</tp:taxon-name> Erdös is confirmed as a separate species from <tp:taxon-name>Calosota metallica</tp:taxon-name> based on features of both sexes. It is suggested that <tp:taxon-name>Calosota ariasi</tp:taxon-name> Bolívar y Pieltain may be a synonym of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota aestivalis</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Calosota bolivari</tp:taxon-name> Askew may be a synonym of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota agrili</tp:taxon-name> Nikol’skaya, <tp:taxon-name>Calosota dusmeti</tp:taxon-name> Bolívar y Pieltain may be a synonym of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota violascens</tp:taxon-name> Masi, and <tp:taxon-name>Calosota lixobia</tp:taxon-name> Erdös likely is not a junior synonym of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota obscura</tp:taxon-name> Ruschka, but formal nomenclatural changes are not proposed prior to a comprehensive Palaearctic revision. Previous interpretation of the mesoscutum in <tp:taxon-name>Calosota</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Balcha</tp:taxon-name> Walker is also modified to include the presence of anteroadmedian lines in addition to notauli and parapsidal lines.</p>

            <title>Introduction</title>
            <p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Noyes (2003)</xref> listed five species of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota</tp:taxon-name> Curtis (<tp:taxon-name>Hymenoptera</tp:taxon-name>: <tp:taxon-name>Eupelmidae</tp:taxon-name>: <tp:taxon-name>Calosotinae</tp:taxon-name>) from the Nearctic region and three from the Neotropical region. The three Neotropical species have never been treated in a modern study except for the names being included in regional catalogs (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">De Santis 1967</xref>, 1979), whereas the five Nearctic species were revised by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Burks (1973)</xref>. Recently, both sexes of a species of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota</tp:taxon-name> reared in Arizona, USA, from the goldspotted oak borer, <tp:taxon-name>Agrilus coxalis</tp:taxon-name> Waterhouse (<tp:taxon-name>Coleoptera</tp:taxon-name>: <tp:taxon-name>Buprestidae</tp:taxon-name>), were sent to me for identification. This species of metallic wood-boring beetle was described originally from Mexico and Guatemala and is not known as a pest there or in Arizona, but in 2004 it was discovered in southern California causing extensive mortality to several oak species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Coleman and Seybold 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2008b</xref>). The female parasitoids did not key reliably to any of the North American species of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota</tp:taxon-name> recognized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Burks (1973)</xref> and subsequent study verified that they represented an undescribed species. However, study also revealed that there were several other undescribed species of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota</tp:taxon-name> in North America, some of which are more widely distributed south of the USA, and that at least two of the three Neotropical species were incorrectly classified to genus and subfamily. I do not describe new species restricted to South America because the five specimens I have seen are too few to evaluate species limits reliably, but I do include specimens from the West Indies and Central America because they provide important information concerning species distributions and sex associations for some of the North American species. Study also revealed that three of the five species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Burks (1973)</xref> recognized in North America occur in Europe under different names. The objective of this study is not a revision of European <tp:taxon-name>Calosota</tp:taxon-name>, but study to clarify species limits and nomenclature for North American species resulted in new observations concerning most of the 13 species of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota</tp:taxon-name> recognized in Europe. These observations are included to help clarify species concepts and stimulate future studies in the region. During the study I also realized that my previous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Gibson 1989</xref>) interpretation of mesoscutal structure relative to the notauli in <tp:taxon-name>Calosotinae</tp:taxon-name> was inaccurate and it is corrected here.<!--PageBreak--></p>

            <p>Observations and descriptions were made with a Nikon SMZ-U stereomicroscope illuminated with a halogen light source. A piece of translucent Mylar tracing acetate was taped to the objective between the light source and specimen to reduce glare (see “viewing specimens” in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Gibson 2000</xref>). Color images were obtained with a Leica DC500 digital camera attached to a Leica Z16 APO macroscope; specimens were illuminated by fiber light sources shone through a Styrofoam diffuser. The serial images obtained were combined with AutoMontage and these and the scanning electron microphotographs obtained with a Philips XL30 environmental scanning electron microscope were digitally retouched using Adobe Photoshop CS4 to enhance clarity. Specimens that were used for macrophotography or scanning electron photomicrography are labeled with a “CNC Photo 2009-no.” or “CNC SEM 2009-no.” label, respectively. The photo or SEM number is included along with the collection data of the specimen under the respective species, and is included between parentheses in the figure captions for specimens other than holotypes and allotypes.</p>
            <p>Terms for fore wing regions and folds follow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Gibson (2004)</xref>. Other terms for structure follow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Gibson (1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">1997)</xref> except for interpretation of anterior lines on the mesoscutum. In <tp:taxon-name>Calosotinae</tp:taxon-name>, parapsidal lines (= parapsides sensu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Vilhelmsen et al. 2010</xref>) are present as slender regions of effaced or minute sculpture anterolaterally on the mesoscutum at the level of the lateral limit of the pronotum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 12: pl</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Gibson 1989</xref>, fig. 72). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Vilhelmsen et al. (2010)</xref> stated that parapsides are absent from <tp:taxon-name>Chalcidoidea</tp:taxon-name>; however, I hypothesized that presence of anteriorly rather than posteriorly positioned parapsidal lines is a possible homoplastic synapomorphy for <tp:taxon-name>Calosotinae</tp:taxon-name> in <tp:taxon-name>Eupelmidae</tp:taxon-name> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Gibson 1989</xref>, character 14: 3, fig. 1). I also stated that paramedial parallel lines of similar effaced or minute sculpture that extend from the posterior margin of the pronotum were the notauli and hypothesized that parallel rather than convergent notauli is a synapomorphy for <tp:taxon-name>Calosota</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Balcha</tp:taxon-name> Walker and <tp:taxon-name>Tanythorax</tp:taxon-name> Gibson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Gibson 1989</xref>, character 7: 4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">figs 35</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">72</xref>). However, I did not appreciate that in <tp:taxon-name>Balcha</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Calosota</tp:taxon-name> lateral to these straight lines of effaced sculpture are often very shallow furrows or slender lines of a different color and/or sculpture that curve from either spiracle to converge and posteriorly closely parallel or sometimes merge with the paramedial parallel lines of sculpture. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Gibson (2005, fig. 33)</xref> provided a good SEM image of the complete complement of the three sets of lines, whereas a slightly incorrect position of the notaulus was indicated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Gibson (2005, fig. 36: not)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Gibson (1989, figs 35, 72: not)</xref>. The straight, paramedial lines of effaced sculpture were indicated as the notauli in the latter images, but closely approximated shallow furrows lateral to these are the true notauli. Here, I use the term “anteroadmedian lines” sensu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Daly (1964)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Gibson (1985)</xref> (= anteroadmedian sigma sensu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Vilhelmsen et al. 2010</xref>) for the inner, straight, paramedial lines of effaced sculpture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 12: aal</xref>) interior to both the notauli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 12: not</xref>) and parapsidal lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 12: pl</xref>). If the anteriorly positioned parapsidal lines of <tp:taxon-name>Calosotinae</tp:taxon-name> are truly homologous with those of other <tp:taxon-name>Hymenoptera</tp:taxon-name> then they are external indication of the lines of attachment of the dorsoventral flight muscles in the pharate pupa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Daly 1964</xref>). The anteroadmedian lines are the external indication of the anterior lines of attachment of the dorsolongitudinal flight muscles in the pharate pupa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Daly 1964</xref>), and were stated as absent from<!--PageBreak--> <tp:taxon-name>Chalcidoidea</tp:taxon-name> by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Vilhelmsen et al. (2010)</xref>. The anteroadmedian lines are more obvious than the notauli in some species of <tp:taxon-name>Balcha</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Calosota</tp:taxon-name>, whereas in at least some <tp:taxon-name>Calosota</tp:taxon-name> only the notauli are evident. Individuals of <tp:taxon-name>Tanythorax</tp:taxon-name> lack anteroadmedian lines and the lines previously interpreted as the notauli are the true notauli in this genus.</p>
            <p>Type data for species described originally outside of North America are given under synonymy for the respective species, but for previously described regional species are included in material examined. Although the sexes of <tp:taxon-name>Calosotinae</tp:taxon-name> do not differ morphologically as conspicuously as do male and female <tp:taxon-name>Eupelminae</tp:taxon-name>, an allotype male is designated for new species if males are recognized. Exact label data are given for the holotype and allotype, with a semicolon used to designate data on different labels. Data for other specimens are standardized as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Gibson (2009)</xref>. For new species, a description of the holotype and allotype is given that includes exact measurements and ratios for the specimens. Measurements were made using a 10 mm ocular grid having 100 divisions. Relative measurements cited in the text were all taken at maximum magnification where 1 unit = 0.054 mm, except for comparison of wing vein lengths where magnification was adjusted so that length of the stigmal vein equaled 10 units. Variation observed for other specimens assigned to the species is noted following the description of the holotype and allotype. Previously described species include separate, more general descriptions of both sexes that are based on regional specimens only. Abbreviations used in the descriptions are: cc (costal cell), fu (funicular segment) number, IOD (minimum distance between inner orbits), LOL (minimum distance between anterior and posterior ocellus), MPOD (maximum diameter of posterior ocellus), mv (marginal vein), OOL (minimum distance between ocellus and inner orbit), pmv (postmarginal vein), POL (minimum distance between posterior ocelli), and stv (stigmal vein). Measurements of antennal articles include length and, in parentheses, width. Width of antennal articles does not include the length of projecting setae and therefore measurements are influenced by setal density and the extent to which setae are appressed to the article. Length of the mesosoma is medial length in dorsal view from the anterior margin of the pronotum to the posterior margin of the propodeal foramen, whereas length of the gaster is medial length in dorsal view from the anterior margin of the petiole to the apex of the ovipositor sheaths. Axillar width is the superficial dorsal width, that is, the horizontal dorsal surface measured between its outer and inner margins not including the lateral axillar carina. Width of the scutellum is the maximum width including the lateral scutellar carinae. Apparent length of the scutellum differs depending on whether or not the mesonotum is arched. When arched, the dorsellum (= metascutellum of some authors) overlies the apex of the (meso)scutellum so as to conceal a usually somewhat differently sculptured and colored transverse frenal area that is normally exposed if the mesonotum is not arched. Consequently, the scutellum superficially appears shorter if the mesonotum is arched and for this reason its length to width ratio is based only on specimens with a nonflexed mesonotum that have the frenal area visible. Width of the syntergum is maximum width measured at the level of the cerci (transcercal width). Unless specified otherwise, length of the syntergum is measured in dorsal view between its posterior margin and the level of the carina that delimits each cercus anteriorly. This method of measuring syntergal length is used be<!--PageBreak-->cause the posterior margin of the penultimate tergum extends beyond the level of the cerci in females of most species, but the tergum is moveable to some extent so that the amount it overlaps the base of the syntergum differs in different specimens. When the posterior margin of the penultimate tergum does not extend fully over the base of the syntergum a bare, less coarsely sculptured basal region of the syntergum is exposed. Different methods of drying, such as air or critical-point drying, can also result in the gaster being variably collapsed, shrunken or inflated and therefore measurements and ratios involving the gaster are often quite variable.</p>
            <p>For ease of description the head is divided into several general regions, including the vertex (dorsal surface between level of anterior ocellus and posterior orbits of eyes), occiput (convex surface dorsally posterior to outer orbits of eyes), frontovertex (vertex and convex part of frontal surface below anterior ocellus), scrobal depression (more or less ∩-like concave region above level of toruli that includes a smooth and shiny scrobe above each torulus), interantennal region (convex, triangular region between scrobes), parascrobal region (convex region between inner orbit and scrobal depression), and lower face (frontal surface below toruli), which includes a clypeal region (medial region delimited by vertical sulci or carinae) and paraclypeal region (surface between clypeal region and malar sulcus).</p>
            <p>The acropleuron usually has a complex pattern of sculpture that most often is differentiated into three regions: a more or less mesal, variably elongate, obliquely angled coriaceous-granular or “microsculptured” region and much larger anterior and posterior regions of different sculpture that intergrade around the microsculptured region. Description of the sculpture is simplified to general sculpture type anterior and posterior of the microsculptured region. An important structural feature not previously used for species recognition in <tp:taxon-name>Calosota</tp:taxon-name> is whether the lower mesepimeron sensu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Gibson (1989)</xref> is visible in lateral view as a convex, subtriangular or lunate region between the acropleuron, anteroventral margin of the metapleuron, and basal margin of the metacoxa (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Figs 52</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">56: lmp</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Gibson 1989</xref>, figs 33, 34) or whether the acropleuron extends completely to the metapleuron and base of the metacoxa. For simplicity, the former structure is called an “exposed” lower mesepimeron and the later structure a “reduced” lower mesepimeron. When reduced, only a remnant of the putative lower mesepimeron remains below the level of the convex acropleuron between the posteroventral margin of the acropleuron and the basal margin of the metacoxa (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Figs 51, 54: lmp</xref>). The lower mesepimeron can be bare (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Figs 55</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">−57</xref>) or setose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Figs 52, 53</xref>) whether exposed or reduced, though when reduced it usually has only one or a few inconspicuous setae (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Figs 51</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">81</xref>) that often are best observed from a ventrolateral or posteroventral view.</p>

                    <p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Gibson (1989)</xref> provided a key to differentiate <tp:taxon-name>Calosota</tp:taxon-name> from the other seven described world genera of <tp:taxon-name>Calosotinae</tp:taxon-name>. Individuals are differentiated from other New World <tp:taxon-name>Calosotinae</tp:taxon-name> by the following combination of features: axillae widely separated and with straight rather than incurved inner margins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Figs 71</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">78</xref>); mesoscutum without distinctly V-like convergent notauli, but anterodorsally with one or two sets of subparallel lines consisting of notauli and/or anteroadmedian lines between parapsidal lines (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 12</xref>); scutellum truncate anteriorly and carinate laterally posterior to axilla; prepectus extending to tegula when mesonotum not arched; mesoscutum coriaceous to reticulate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Figs 71</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">–78</xref>), but not umbilicate.</p>
                    <p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Gibson (1989)</xref> gave a detailed generic description for <tp:taxon-name>Calosota</tp:taxon-name>. Characteristic features that are not treated in the following descriptions are: dorsellum reticulate to reticulate-strigose and variably expanded over apex of scutellum depending on whether mesonotum flexed or not; female propodeum with foramen incurved to or almost to anterior margin and with lateral longitudinal furrow or carina delineating median, bowtie-like, plical region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Figs 74, 79</xref>), but male propodeum much longer medially and therefore plical region more distinctly longitudinally strigose- or carinate-coriaceous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Figs 72</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">77</xref>); metapleuron setose; mesotarsus ventrally with row of yellowish to reddish tarsal pegs on either side; metatibia with inconspicuous row of spinelike denticles along dorsal length.</p>

                    <p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Noyes (2003)</xref> listed <tp:taxon-name>Calosota eneubulus</tp:taxon-name> (Walker, 1838), <tp:taxon-name>Calosota cecidobius</tp:taxon-name> (Kieffer, 1910), and <tp:taxon-name>Calosota silvai</tp:taxon-name> (Brèthes, 1917) as three Neotropical species of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota</tp:taxon-name>. <tp:taxon-name>Calosota chrysideus</tp:taxon-name> (Ashmead, 1900) had previously been transferred to <tp:taxon-name>Eusandalum</tp:taxon-name> Ratzeburg by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Gibson (1989: 56)</xref>.</p>
                    <p><tp:taxon-name>Calosota eneubulus</tp:taxon-name> was described originally in <tp:taxon-name>Pteromalus</tp:taxon-name> Swederus by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">Walker (1838: 475)</xref> from males collected in Galapagos Islands (Charles’s Island), and subsequently was transferred by him to <tp:taxon-name>Calosoter</tp:taxon-name> Walker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">Walker 1846</xref>: 52). I examined two male syntypes in the BMNH (one labeled as lectotype by Z. Bouček in 1979) and de<!--PageBreak-->termined that they are males of a species of <tp:taxon-name>Eupelmus (Eupelmus)</tp:taxon-name> Dalman; therefore, I hereby classify the species as <tp:taxon-name>Eupelmus (Eupelmus) eneubulus</tp:taxon-name> (Walker) comb. n.</p>
                    <p><tp:taxon-name>Calosota silvai</tp:taxon-name> was described originally in <tp:taxon-name>Calosoter</tp:taxon-name> by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Brèthes (1917: 26–27)</xref> from an unstated number of females reared from the eggs of <tp:taxon-name>Macromphalia dedecora</tp:taxon-name> Feisthamel (<tp:taxon-name>Lepidoptera</tp:taxon-name>: <tp:taxon-name>Lasiocampidae</tp:taxon-name>) in Chile, and was transferred to <tp:taxon-name>Calosota</tp:taxon-name> by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">De Santis (1979: 11, 169)</xref>. Two female syntypes on one card remain in MACN, plus a microscope slide with legs, a fore wing, and an antenna (J. Martinez, personal communication). Based on photographic images provided to me by J. Martinez, including a dorsal and lateral habitus, propodeal structure, fore wing venation and setal pattern, antennal structure, and mesotibial peg and mesotarsal peg pattern, I hereby transfer <tp:taxon-name>Calosota silvai</tp:taxon-name> to <tp:taxon-name>Brasema</tp:taxon-name> Cameron as <tp:taxon-name>Brasema silvai</tp:taxon-name> (Brèthes) comb. n.</p>
                    <p><tp:taxon-name>Calosota cecidobius</tp:taxon-name> was described originally in <tp:taxon-name>Calosoter</tp:taxon-name> by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Kieffer and Jörgensen (1910: 424)</xref> from Argentina and was transferred to <tp:taxon-name>Calosota</tp:taxon-name> by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">De Santis (1967: 172)</xref>. Kieffer at least believed he had both sexes because the structure of the antenna was stated to be alike in both sexes. If so, <tp:taxon-name>Calosota cecidobius</tp:taxon-name> is very likely a member of <tp:taxon-name>Calosotinae</tp:taxon-name> because based on the rest of the description there is no indication of strong sexual dimorphism, which characterizes <tp:taxon-name>Eupelminae</tp:taxon-name>, and no genus of <tp:taxon-name>Neanastatinae</tp:taxon-name> is suggested by the description. The axillae are described as being separated by about their own width, which could indicate a species of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota</tp:taxon-name>, though other genera of <tp:taxon-name>Calosotinae</tp:taxon-name> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Gibson 1989</xref>) and some female <tp:taxon-name>Eupelminae</tp:taxon-name> also have the axillae noticeably separated (see figs in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Gibson 1995</xref>). Further, the original description states that the mesotarsus has two rows of short, black, thick spines ventrally. The mesotarsal pegs in <tp:taxon-name>Calosota</tp:taxon-name> can be somewhat yellowish-brown similar to the color of the tarsus, to reddish distally, but they are not black in distinct contrast to a lighter colored tarsus. Black mesotarsal pegs that contrast distinctly with the tarsus is more indicative of most female <tp:taxon-name>Eupelminae</tp:taxon-name>. The anal segment of the abdomen is also described as having a transverse row of erect black bristles. Although some female <tp:taxon-name>Calosota</tp:taxon-name> have quite distinct, longer, dark setae along the curved posterior margin of the syntergum, a transverse row of bristle-like setae is most obvious for females of <tp:taxon-name>Brasema</tp:taxon-name> that have the syntergal margin slightly emarginate rather than posteriorly curved in dorsal view. Most ambiguous is the statement “Thorax vorn gewölbt, am Mesonotum eingedrückt, Parapsiden furchen fehlen” (Thorax convex in front, impressed/concave at the mesonotum, parapsidal furrows absent). It is possible that Kieffer was referring to the mesoscutum rather than the entire mesonotum being impressed. Females of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota</tp:taxon-name> often have the mesoscutum quite abruptly, convexly raised behind the pronotum and often low convex or flat to slightly depressed dorsally anterior to a flat or variably convex scutellum (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 27</xref>). The mesoscutum of female <tp:taxon-name>Eupelminae</tp:taxon-name> is characteristically concave posteromedially behind a convex anteromedial lobe between convex lateral lobes, with the anteromedial lobe being separated from the lateral lobes by variably developed V-like furrows (see figs in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Gibson 1995</xref>). If Kieffer was in fact describing the mesoscutal structure of a female eupelmine it is likely he would have interpreted these furrows as parapsidal furrows rather than stating that these are absent. Furthermore, even though he described the two small protibial apical spines that are characteristic of both sexes of Eupelm<!--PageBreak-->idae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Gibson 1989</xref>) he did not mention mesotibial apical pegs. Mesotibial apical pegs, when present, usually are more obvious than protibial apical spines. They are absent from most <tp:taxon-name>Calosota</tp:taxon-name> but are possessed by females of the most likely eupelmine genera to have been described from South America, such as <tp:taxon-name>Brasema</tp:taxon-name>. The overall description of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota cecidobius</tp:taxon-name> therefore supports it as a member of <tp:taxon-name>Calosotinae</tp:taxon-name> and mostly likely as a member of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota</tp:taxon-name>, though I am not completely satisfied with this conclusion because of some aspects of the description. Future rearing of <tp:taxon-name>Tetradiplosis sexdentatus</tp:taxon-name> Kieffer &amp; Jorgensen (<tp:taxon-name>Diptera</tp:taxon-name>: <tp:taxon-name>Cecidomyiidae</tp:taxon-name>) galls, the stated host, in Argentina should help resolve the uncertainty because all the coxae were described as whitish in <tp:taxon-name>Calosota cecidobius</tp:taxon-name>, which is presently unknown for any <tp:taxon-name>Calosotinae</tp:taxon-name> and is quite unusual for <tp:taxon-name>Eupelminae</tp:taxon-name>.</p>

Head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 1</xref>) with variably large green spot below anterior ocellus and variably extensively and conspicuously green along inner orbit except parascrobal region always with dark band at about dorsal limit of interantennal region, usually partly green within scrobal depression and on interantennal region under different angles of light, and at least obscurely green (sometimes greenish with coppery luster under some angles of light) on lower face, but otherwise dark from level of posterior margin of eyes to about dorsal level of interantennal region, and parascrobal region usually dark along scrobal depression; posterior surface of head dark to sometimes greenish-blue under different angles of light except more distinctly bluish-purple in variably complete ∩-shaped band along outer orbit and occiput. Maxillary and labial palpi dark. Antenna dark except scape variably extensively yellow basally (usually with about basal quarter to third yellow), and dark part of scape and pedicel sometimes with green luster under some angles of light. Tegula yellow. Mesoscutum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 28</xref>) variably extensively greenish-blue to bluish-purple laterally, but parapsidal line, anteroadmedian line or region between anteroadmedian line and notaulus, and dorsomedially anterior to base of scutellum coppery or greenish with coppery luster; scutellar-axillar complex mostly similar in color to mesoscutum medially except frenal area bluish-purple. Acropleuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Fig. 52</xref>) variably bluish-green except microsculptured region or diffuse region extending obliquely from microsculptured region toward tegula coppery. Legs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 42</xref>) with<!--PageBreak--> femur and tibia of front leg variably extensively dark, but trochanter and trochantellus at least distinctly lighter in color and knee, apex of tibia, and tarsus yellow; middle leg often entirely yellow beyond coxa but sometimes with similar color pattern as front leg except femur and tibia much lighter brownish-yellow; hind leg usually yellow beyond coxa though sometimes up to about basal two-thirds of femur brownish or dark with very slight metallic luster. Fore wing hyaline; setae uniformly brown. Gaster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 42</xref>) mostly brown dorsally but syntergum and gaster laterally more bluish-green, similar to mesosoma laterally.</p>
                        <p>Structure/setation. Head in dorsal view about 1.9–2× as wide as long, with IOD about 0.4–0.47× head width, OOL slightly more than half, LOL subequal to, and POL almost twice MPOD; in frontal view about 1.1–1.2× as wide as high, with ventral margin to about middle of torulus at level of lower orbits; malar space about 0.55–0.7× height of eye. Head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figs 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">67</xref>) with frontovertex finely meshlike coriaceous, the sculpture at least obscurely extended ventromedially within scrobal depression between smooth and shiny scrobes; parascrobal region finely coriaceous dorsally to somewhat more vertically coriaceous-alutaceous ventrally; clypeal region microcoriaceous, but interantennal region and paraclypeal region coriaceous-reticulate except smoother narrowly along lower inner orbit. Head with white setae except for bare scrobal depression. Antenna (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 28</xref>) with scape about 3.6–4.2× as long as wide; pedicel about 2–2.3× as long as wide; flagellum clavate with length of flagellum + pedicle about 1.4× head width; combined length of fu1 + fu2 slightly greater than (larger specimens) to slightly less than (smaller specimens) length of pedicel; fu1 obviously longer than wide except in small specimens, but less than 1.5× as long as wide; subsequent funiculars oblong basally to only slightly longer than wide or subquadrate apically with fu2 about 1.5–2× and fu8 at most about 1.2× as long as wide; clava often slightly collapsed (compressed), but about as long as apical three funiculars. Mesoscutum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figs 12</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">74</xref>) meshlike-reticulate with somewhat larger flat-bottomed reticulations medially, and with comparatively inconspicuous white setae; usually with quite deep and distinct notauli on inclined anterior surface and with quite distinct parapsidal lines, but with only obscure anteroadmedian lines on anterior inclined surface indicated by longitudinal region of slightly different color or sculpture. Axillae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figs 28</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">74</xref>) large, almost equilateral-triangular in smaller specimens, and separated by only about 1–1.5× own width. Scutellum low convex, about 1.3–1.4× as long as wide; similarly reticulate as mesoscutum laterally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Fig. 74</xref>); with inconspicuous white setae. Mesopleuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Fig. 52</xref>) with exposed, setose lower mesepimeron; acropleuron variably extensively reticulate anteriorly, becoming more coriaceous to obliquely coriaceous-alutaceous anterior to oblique microsculptured region and very finely, longitudinally to slightly obliquely alutaceous-aciculate posteriorly. Fore wing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Fig. 58</xref>) with cc: mv: stv: pmv about 30–35: 21–25: 10: 17–20; basal cell entirely setose; cubital area usually quite extensively setose behind mediocubital fold and/or apically, and closed by setae along posterior margin over about apical half; disc basally with oblique bare band separated from basal fold, parastigma and base of marginal vein, and with short region of mediocubital fold bare just beyond basal fold. Metacoxa <!--PageBreak-->setose along dorsal and ventral margins and outer surface usually extensively though less densely setose basally. Propodeum with callus setose to posterior margin; bare anteriorly between spiracle and foramen. Gaster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figs 28</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">42</xref>) about 1.6–2× as long as mesosoma; more or less uniformly covered with inconspicuous white, hairlike setae; penultimate tergum with posterior margin extending to or slightly beyond level of cerci; syntergum about 1–1.8× as long as transcercal width, uniformly convex, and about 0.8–0.9× as long as penultimate tergum.</p>
                        <p>MALE (based on single regional specimen). Similar to female except as follows. Antenna with scape more robust, only about 3× as long as wide; fu1 + fu2 about 1.4× length of pedicel, fu1 about 2× as long as wide, fu8 about 1.2× as long as wide, and clava only slightly longer than combined length of apical two funiculars.

                        <p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Noyes (2003)</xref> listed <tp:taxon-name>Calosota acron</tp:taxon-name> from several countries in Western Europe; I saw females from Croatia (CNC), England (BMNH), France (CNC Photo 2009-33, USNM) and Sweden (BMNH). The species has only been rarely collected in North America in the lower Fraser Valley in British Columbia and Washington and Oregon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Map 1</xref>). This restricted distribution and its host biology strongly indicates <tp:taxon-name>Calosota acron</tp:taxon-name> is not a naturally occurring Holarctic species but likely was introduced accidentally in wood products relatively recently through the port of Vancouver (Canada) or perhaps Seattle (USA).</p>

                        <title>Recognition.</title>
                        <p>Although I did not examine the lectotype of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota acron</tp:taxon-name>, my concept of this name and new synonymy of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota pseudotsugae</tp:taxon-name> is based on the keys of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Graham (1969)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Askew and Nieves-Aldrey (2006)</xref>, and comparison of North American specimens with <!--PageBreak-->authoritatively identified specimens of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota acron</tp:taxon-name> from Europe in the BMNH. Some females seen from Europe are up to about 7.5 mm, their much larger size suggesting the possibility of different, larger hosts. The larger females have all the legs entirely yellow beyond the coxae, can have up to about the basal half of the scape yellow, typically have a more distinct coppery region on the mesoscutum extending posteriorly from each parapsidal line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 12</xref>), and the syntergum is somewhat more elongate-slender, up to about twice as long as the transcercal width, as indicated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Graham (1969)</xref>. The larger females also have much more obvious anteroadmedian lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 12</xref>), which appears to be at least partly correlated with specimen size in <tp:taxon-name>Calosota</tp:taxon-name>. However, I hereby synonymize the name <tp:taxon-name>Calosota pseudotsugae</tp:taxon-name> under <tp:taxon-name>Calosota acron</tp:taxon-name> syn. n. because North American and European specimens do not differ substantially in morphology. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Askew and Nieves-Aldrey (2006)</xref> suggested that <tp:taxon-name>Calosota ariasi</tp:taxon-name> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Bolívar y Pieltain (1929)</xref> might be a synonym of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota acron</tp:taxon-name>, but this European name more likely is a junior synonym of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota aestivalis</tp:taxon-name> if not a valid species (see under <tp:taxon-name>Calosota aestivalis</tp:taxon-name>).</p>
                        <p><tp:taxon-name>Calosota acron</tp:taxon-name> is recognized primarily by the presence of an oblique fore wing linea calva (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Fig. 58</xref>). <tp:taxon-name>Calosota albipalpus</tp:taxon-name> sometimes also has a variably developed oblique bare band, though typically there is then also a narrow bare region along the basal fold. Regardless, <tp:taxon-name>Calosota acron</tp:taxon-name> is readily differentiated from <tp:taxon-name>Calosota albipalpus</tp:taxon-name> by several features, including dark palpi and an exposed and at least sparsely setose lower mesepimeron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Fig. 52</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Askew and Nieves-Aldrey (2006, fig. 14)</xref> noted that the outer surface of the metacoxa is mostly setose, but this is variable and smaller specimens typically have the outer surface more extensively bare mediolongitudinally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Fig. 52</xref>).</p>

Head in dorsal view about 1.8−2.1× as wide as long, with IOD about 0.33−0.45× head width, LOL at least slightly greater than and sometimes up to about 2× OOL and slightly less than to slightly greater than MPOD, and POL about 1.2−1.7× MPOD; in frontal view about 1.2−1.3× as wide as high, with dorsal margin of torulus about at level of lower orbits; malar space about 0.5−0.7× eye height. Head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 2</xref>) with frontovertex and upper parascrobal region meshlike reticulate to about level of dorsal limit of interantennal region, medially the reticulations tapered ventrally between dorsal limits of smooth and shiny scrobes; lower parascrobal region and interantennal region much shallower meshlike reticulate to coriaceous-reticulate; clypeal region microcoriaceous to granular and paraclypeal region obliquely reticulate-alutaceous. Head sometimes with whitish setae except for bare scrobal depression but more commonly with brownish setae on frontovertex and more conspicuous white setae on parascrobal region, interantennal region and lower face. Antenna (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 33</xref>) with scape about 4.6−5.3× as long as wide; pedicel about 2.5−3.3× as long as wide; flagellum variably distinctly clavate (funiculars all about same width and clava usually only slightly wider than funicle except if compressed) with length of flagellum + pedicel about 1.3−1.75× head width; combined length of fu1 + fu2 about 1−1.7× as long as pedicel; fu1 about 1.3−2.3× as long as wide; subsequent funiculars all longer than wide with fu2 about 2−3.1× and fu8 at least slightly and sometimes up to about 1.5× as long as wide; clava often collapsed, but about as long as apical 2.5−3.5 funiculars. <!--PageBreak-->Mesoscutum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figs 13, 14</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">72</xref>) more or less uniformly meshlike reticulate, with inconspicuous white setae; notaulus extending from spiracle as curved furrow on inclined anterior surface, its posterior limit contiguous dorsally with posterior limit of anteroadmedian line; parapsidal line usually quite a distinct region of microsculpture posterior to spiracle. Axillae elongate-triangular, separated by about 3−4× own width (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Fig. 72</xref>). Scutellum flat to low convex and at least slightly (up to about 1.2x) longer than wide; similarly reticulate as mesoscutum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">Fig. 72</xref>); with inconspicuous white setae.

                        <p>MALE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 46</xref>). Similar to female except as follows. Length about 2.5−3.8 mm. Color. Legs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 46</xref>) always extensively dark with knees and tarsi often yellowish but tibiae usually only slightly lighter apically; all males examined with M-like region on upper face and with lateral arms extending ventrally to inner orbits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 2</xref>); mesonotum more commonly (particularly smaller individuals) without distinct paramedial bands; fore wing disc often, but at most only very slightly infuscate.</p>

Antenna with scape more robust, only about 3.4−3.9× as long as wide; flagellum of smaller individuals sometimes more distinctly clavate, the funicle evenly widened toward clava; fu1 variably distinctly widened distally and sometimes only about as long as wide, but usually quite obviously (up to about 1.5x) longer than wide; fu2 about 1−1.9× as long as wide or length of fu1; combined length of fu1 + fu2 about 0.65× (smallest specimens) to about 1.25× length of pedicel; and fu8 quadrate to slightly longer than wide. Fore wing venation similar to female with cc: mv: stv: pmv about 38−52: 22−31: 10: 13−14, and perpendicular distance between apex of stigmal vein and anterior margin of wing about 0.8−0.9× length of stigmal vein; basal cell and disc completely setose or sometimes disc with arcuate bare band along basal fold, but bare region only rarely continuous with cubital area. Propodeal callus sometimes setose to posterior margin, and then rarely with one or more setae anteriorly<!--PageBreak--> between spiracle and foramen, but more often setose only to level about equal with posterior margin of spiracle, with 1 or 2 setae often behind spiracle but bare anteriorly between spiracle and foramen.</p>

                        <p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Noyes (2003)</xref> listed several countries in the Palaearctic region; I saw specimens from Corsica (CNC SEM 2009-48, ZSMC), Cyprus (NMPC), England (BMNH), France (BMNH, CNC), Jordan (CNC), Morocco (CNC), Slovakia (CNC), Spain (CNC) and Sweden (CNC). Its extensive, apparently transcontinental distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Map 2</xref>) and morphological variability in North America (see further below) suggest that it has been present in the region for a long time as a naturally occurring Holarctic species. Its presence in North America for a long time may also be<!--PageBreak--> supported by head sculpture pattern, which is shared with four other similar species in North America (<tp:taxon-name>Calosota bicolorata</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Calosota elongata</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Calosota longivena</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Calosota longiventris</tp:taxon-name>), but not with any other species in at least Western Europe. This suggests that <tp:taxon-name>Calosota aestivalis</tp:taxon-name> may be more closely related to the four North American species than it is to any species from Western Europe. This hypothesis needs be tested through phylogenetic or molecular analyses.</p>

Although I did not examine the lectotype of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota aestivalis</tp:taxon-name>, my concept of this name is based on the keys of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Graham (1969)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Askew and Nieves-Aldrey (2006)</xref> plus authoritatively identified specimens in the collections listed above. I examined the holotype female of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota septentrionalis</tp:taxon-name> in 1984 and at that time considered that it probably was a synonym of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota aestivalis</tp:taxon-name>, noting that the vertex was reticulate in both. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Hedqvist (1956)</xref> compared his new species to <tp:taxon-name>Calosota aestivalis</tp:taxon-name> (as <tp:taxon-name>Calosota vernalis)</tp:taxon-name> and differentiated the latter species from <tp:taxon-name>Calosota septentrionalis</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Calosota fumipennis</tp:taxon-name> based on the fore wing being either yellowish or more or less infuscate, respectively. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Graham (1969)</xref> noted that European females of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota aestivalis</tp:taxon-name> often have the fore wings partly infuscate, which is the form that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Bolívar y Pieltain (1923)</xref> described as <tp:taxon-name>Calosota fumipennis</tp:taxon-name>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Hedqvist (1956)</xref> differentiated <tp:taxon-name>Calosota septentrionalis</tp:taxon-name> from <tp:taxon-name>Calosota fumipennis</tp:taxon-name> on color differences as well as equally variable differences in the ratios of the marginal, postmarginal and stigmal veins, but stated specifically that <tp:taxon-name>Calosota septentrionalis</tp:taxon-name> has paramedial longitudinal greenish-bronze bands on the mesoscutum. Based on this color pattern, head sculpture pattern, and other features <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Hedqvist (1956)</xref> used in his key to differentiate species, I hereby synonymize <tp:taxon-name>Calosota septentrionalis</tp:taxon-name> under <tp:taxon-name>Calosota aestivalis</tp:taxon-name> syn. n., as was done previously for <tp:taxon-name>Calosota fumipennis</tp:taxon-name> by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Askew and Nieves-Aldrey (2006)</xref>.</p>
                        <p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Askew and Nieves-Aldrey (2006)</xref> suggested that another European name, <tp:taxon-name>Calosota ariasi</tp:taxon-name> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Bolívar y Pieltain (1929)</xref>, whose unique female holotype had been lost from its mount in MNCN, might also be a synonym of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota acron</tp:taxon-name>. They refrained from formalizing the synonymy because of some significant discrepancies between the original description of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota ariasi</tp:taxon-name> and specimens of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota acron</tp:taxon-name>. Based on its original description, <tp:taxon-name>Calosota ariasi</tp:taxon-name> more likely is a synonym of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota aestivalis</tp:taxon-name> than <tp:taxon-name>Calosota acron</tp:taxon-name>. The description of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota ariasi</tp:taxon-name> states that the head had a transverse coppery band behind the ocelli as well as a coppery band extending from each posterior ocellus to surround the anterior ocellus ventrally and widen on the upper face to about its mid height. This color pattern describes very accurately the color pattern of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota aestivalis</tp:taxon-name> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 2</xref>) but not <tp:taxon-name>Calosota acron</tp:taxon-name> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 1</xref>), which has the frontovertex mostly dark. The described bluish-black femora and brownish-black tibiae except for the knees and apex of the tibiae and very slightly infuscate fore wings also more strongly suggest <tp:taxon-name>Calosota aestivalis</tp:taxon-name> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 33</xref>) than <tp:taxon-name>Calosota acron</tp:taxon-name>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Askew and Nieves-Aldrey (2006)</xref><!--PageBreak--> keyed <tp:taxon-name>Calosota ariasi</tp:taxon-name> along with <tp:taxon-name>Calosota vernalis</tp:taxon-name>, primarily because the original description states that the distance between the eyes was the same as the width of an eye. Description of head sculpture for <tp:taxon-name>Calosota ariasi</tp:taxon-name> (weakly shagreened dorsally and face strongly shagreened, almost scale-like) might also be interpreted as descriptive of the head sculpture of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota vernalis</tp:taxon-name> (see under this species), but the acropleuron is described as being very shagreened over its basal two-fifths, especially dorsally. This is characteristic of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota aestivalis</tp:taxon-name> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Fig. 55</xref>) but not <tp:taxon-name>Calosota vernalis</tp:taxon-name> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Fig. 54</xref>), which suggests description of the head sculpture actually referred to a somewhat coarser reticulate sculpture below than above the anterior ocellus that is also typical of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota aestivalis</tp:taxon-name> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 2</xref>). As noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Askew and Nieves-Aldrey (2006)</xref>, described shape and width of its axillae, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Bolívar y Pieltain (1929)</xref> used as key features to differentiate <tp:taxon-name>Calosota ariasi</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Calosota aestivalis</tp:taxon-name> (as <tp:taxon-name>Calosota vernalis</tp:taxon-name> + <tp:taxon-name>Calosota fumipennis)</tp:taxon-name> from other Spanish <tp:taxon-name>Calosota</tp:taxon-name>, also contradicts the possibility of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota ariasi</tp:taxon-name> being synonymous with <tp:taxon-name>Calosota vernalis</tp:taxon-name>. The features used to distinguish <tp:taxon-name>Calosota ariasi</tp:taxon-name> from <tp:taxon-name>Calosota aestivalis</tp:taxon-name> by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Bolívar y Pieltain (1929)</xref> (anellus only about one-third longer than wide versus twice as long as wide and syntergum twice as long versus only about as long as wide) certainly are within the range of variation noted for North American specimens I identify as <tp:taxon-name>Calosota aestivalis</tp:taxon-name>. It seems likely that <tp:taxon-name>Calosota ariasi</tp:taxon-name> is a synonym of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota aestivalis</tp:taxon-name>, but I hesitate to formalize the synonymy prior to a more comprehensive revision of Spanish and European <tp:taxon-name>Calosota</tp:taxon-name>.</p>
                        <p>When <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Burks (1973: 31)</xref> described <tp:taxon-name>Calosota montana</tp:taxon-name> he stated that it “greatly resembles the European species vernalis Curtis”, but it is apparent he was still misinterpreting the name <tp:taxon-name>Calosota vernalis</tp:taxon-name> in the sense of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota aestivalis</tp:taxon-name> based on other features listed as shared between “<tp:taxon-name>Calosota vernalis</tp:taxon-name>” and <tp:taxon-name>Calosota montana</tp:taxon-name>. The presence or absence of longitudinal banding on the mesoscutum (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figs 13, 14</xref>), shading on the fore wing, and a bare region on the fore wing disc adjacent to the basal fold were all used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Burks (1973)</xref> to differentiate <tp:taxon-name>Calosota montana</tp:taxon-name> (western USA: Montana) from <tp:taxon-name>Calosota kentra</tp:taxon-name> (eastern USA: New Hampshire). Based on observation of more material, females with infuscate wings normally have the disc more or less uniformly setose to the basal cell whereas females with hyaline wings typically have a more definite bare band adjacent to the basal fold, but all the features used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Burks (1973)</xref> to differentiate <tp:taxon-name>Calosota montana</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Calosota kentra</tp:taxon-name> appear to be present in different combinations, including structure of the stigma and uncus. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Burks (1973, fig. 2)</xref> partly characterized the holotype of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota montana</tp:taxon-name> as having an enlarged stigma with a long, slender uncus. The holotypes of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota montana</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Calosota kentra</tp:taxon-name> are both similar to European females of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota aestivalis</tp:taxon-name> in having the stigmal vein comparatively long and at an acute angle to the postmarginal vein such that the perpendicular distance between its apex and the anterior margin of the wing is only about 0.8× its length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Fig. 60</xref>). Both holotypes also have an M-like region differentiated on the upper face (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 2</xref>) as well as at least an obscurely differentiated transverse region on the vertex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 14</xref>), and the marginal vein is only about 2.4× as long as the stigmal vein (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Fig. 60</xref>). I consider the morphological differences between the type material of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota kentra</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Calosota montana</tp:taxon-name> to represent intraspecific variation in one quite variable and widely distributed species in North America and therefore synonymize both <tp:taxon-name>Calosota kentra</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Calosota montana</tp:taxon-name> under <tp:taxon-name>Calosota aestivalis</tp:taxon-name> syn. n. However, I also describe a new species, <tp:taxon-name>Calosota longivena</tp:taxon-name>, based on females<!--PageBreak--> that are morphologically very similar to some females I include in <tp:taxon-name>Calosota aestivalis</tp:taxon-name> except for relative length of the marginal vein and, usually, a somewhat differently structured stigmal vein. Furthermore, the single female from Oklahoma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Map 2</xref>) that I include in <tp:taxon-name>Calosota aestivalis</tp:taxon-name> is intermediate in some features between those I identify as <tp:taxon-name>Calosota aestivalis</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Calosota longivena</tp:taxon-name>. In addition to having distinctly infuscate fore wings and an obvious bare band adjacent to the basal cell, the Oklahoma female is unusual in having a comparatively short and straight stigmal vein (perpendicular length from its apex to anterior margin of wing almost equal to its length) and an unusually long costal cell and marginal vein as compared to other females I identify as <tp:taxon-name>Calosota aestivalis</tp:taxon-name>. The Oklahoma female has the marginal vein about 3.2× and the costal cell about 6× as long as the stigmal vein compared to up to about 2.8× and up to about 4.8x, respectively, for other <tp:taxon-name>Calosota aestivalis</tp:taxon-name> females. Females of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota longivena</tp:taxon-name> have a shorter and more obtusely angled stigmal vein such that the marginal vein is at least about 3.6× the length of the stigmal vein and stigmal vein length is subequal to the distance from its apex to the anterior margin of the wing. Although the paramedial bands on the mesoscutum of the Oklahoma female are also somewhat obscurely differentiated it has quite a distinct M-like coppery region on the upper face. The combination of features of the Oklahoma female suggests the possibility of introgression or a morphological cline in what I identify as <tp:taxon-name>Calosota aestivalis</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Calosota longivena</tp:taxon-name>. The southeastern Oklahoma origin of the aberrant female, between the known distribution of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota longivena</tp:taxon-name> (Florida to southwestern Texas) and what appears to be a more northern transcontinental and further eastern (California) distribution for <tp:taxon-name>Calosota aestivalis</tp:taxon-name> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Map 2</xref>), might also support a hypothesis of introgression or morphological cline. However, if females I describe as <tp:taxon-name>Calosota longivena</tp:taxon-name> represent only a highly modified southern form of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota aestivalis</tp:taxon-name> in North America then <tp:taxon-name>Calosota aestivalis</tp:taxon-name> is far more variable in North America than in Europe. Collection of males with females in the known range of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota longivena</tp:taxon-name> could help clarify morphological limits and species status, as could molecular analysis of specimens from throughout North America and Europe. Males I identify as <tp:taxon-name>Calosota aestivalis</tp:taxon-name> are most similar to those of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota longiventris</tp:taxon-name> (see further under latter species and <tp:taxon-name>Calosota bicolorata</tp:taxon-name>).</p>

Antenna with flagellum conspicuously setose and elongate-filiform, the curved setae somewhat longer than width of respective flagellomere; length of flagellum + pedicel about 2.1× width of head; scape: pedicel: fu1–fu11 = 21(8): 10(7): 2(4), 14(5), 16(5), 16(6), 15(6), 15(6), 13(6), 13(6): 13(6): 10(5): 12(5) (including very small apical subsegment). Fore wing with cc: mv: stv: pmv = 50: 55: 10: 12; oblique bare band behind marginal vein distinct for both wings. Scutellum elongate-reticulate rather than distinctly strigose.

                        <p>Females range in length from about 1.5–3 mm and males from about 1.3–2 mm. The metallic lusters of the body vary in intensity, smaller individuals usually being more brownish with less distinct metallic lusters and larger specimens often having the mesoscutum broadly brown with coppery luster medially and the lateral lobes with variably extensive, though quite dark and comparatively inconspicuous green, bluish and/or purple lusters under some angles of light. Females sometimes also have the extreme base of the scape white, the fore wing setae more whitish, though not obviously lighter behind the submarginal than the marginal vein, and the hind legs less extensively brown or rarely completely yellow beyond the metacoxa. Setal pattern of the fore wing disc varies in both sexes. Some specimens have an essentially uniformly setose disc, including a uniformly setose mediocubital fold that extends somewhat basal of the level of the basal fold, whereas others have quite a distinct, posteriorly open bare band along the parastigma and basal fold and/or quite a distinct linea calva (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Fig. 58</xref>). When present, the two bare bands are usually separated by setae, but in some specimens the linea calva is continuous with the basal bare band. Some females have the mesoscutum more uniformly, though extremely shallowly meshlike reticulate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Fig. 76</xref>) to almost coriaceous, the cells defined by only very slightly raised ridges similar to most males. Some females also have the scutellum more distinctly elongate-reticulate than strigose and smaller females tend to have slightly shorter funiculars such that the apical ones are quadrate rather than slightly elongate.</p>
                        <p>I exclude from the type series of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota albipalpus</tp:taxon-name> two males from Dominica that have the mesoscutum mostly smooth and shiny mediolongitudinally anterior to the base of the scutellum (only extremely obscure meshlike coriaceous sculpture under some angles of light), the fore wings more extensively setose (disc without evident bare regions<!--PageBreak--> and about apical half of cubital area closed by setae posteriorly) than for other males, and the tegula yellow similar to males of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota setosa</tp:taxon-name>. These males likely belong to a different species than <tp:taxon-name>Calosota albipalpus</tp:taxon-name>, but females from Dominica are required to adequately assess variation and species limits.</p>

Legs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 34</xref>) with front leg extensively brown but trochantellus, knee, tibia apically and tarsus yellowish; middle leg almost uniformly yellowish-orange beyond coxa though femur somewhat more orange and tibia and tarsus more yellowish; hind leg with most of femur brown and tarsus and most of tibia yellowish, but about apical one-fifth of femur yellowish and tibia brownish dorsomedially. Fore wing hyaline except for brownish region behind marginal and stigmal veins anterior to mediocubital fold; setae uniformly brownish within hyaline regions. Gaster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 34</xref>) mostly brown except terga with slight bluish-purple lusters laterally.</p>

Head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 11</xref>) with frontovertex and parascrobal region very shallowly meshlike reticulate to about level of dorsal limit of interantennal region, medially the reticulations tapered ventrally between dorsal limits of smooth and shiny scrobes; lower parascrobal region coriaceous-alutaceous; interantennal region finely coriaceous-alutaceous dorsally to meshlike coriaceous ventrally; clypeal region microcoriaceous and paraclypeal region obliquely coriaceous to very shallowly reticulate-alutaceous toward inner orbit. Head with inconspicuous, mostly brownish setae on frontovertex and more conspicuous white setae on parascrobal region, interantennal region and lower face.

Mesoscutum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figs 16</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">75</xref>) with inclined anterior surface alutaceous-coriaceous, inclined lateral surface shallowly mes<!--PageBreak-->hlike reticulate, and dorsal surface more deeply meshlike reticulate, with quite conspicuous and dense, very slightly lanceolate white setae; notauli obscure, but anteroadmedian lines and parapsidal lines more distinct as lines of differentiated sculpture and color. Axillae very small, separated by about 5× own maximum width (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Fig. 75</xref>). Scutellum convex, quadrate; elongate reticulate-strigose with deep, much smaller reticulations than on mesoscutum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Fig. 75</xref>); with inconspicuous dark setae. Mesopleuron with exposed, bare lower mesepimeron; acropleuron meshlike coriaceous or coriaceous-reticulate anterior to oblique microsculptured region and very finely, slightly elongate meshlike coriaceous posteriorly. Fore wing with cc: mv: stv: pmv = 50: 22: 10: 13; basal cell entirely setose; cubital area bare but closed by setae along posterior margin over about apical quarter; disc setose except for slender, arcuate bare region along basal fold, the region separated from cubital area by setose mediocubital fold. Metacoxa quite densely and conspicuously setose dorsally and ventrolaterally, the ventrally setose region broadening basally to restrict longitudinal bare band on outer surface within dorsal half. Propodeum with callus densely and conspicuously setose to posterior margin; anteriorly with single white setae midway between spiracle and foramen.

                        <p>Females range in length from about 2.5–3.7 mm and the two known males from 2.9–3.1 mm. All females are quite similar in color except the coppery band behind the ocelli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 16</xref>) varies from being almost completely absent to forming a transverse band behind the posterior ocelli between the inner orbits, the M-like band on the upper face usually does not extend to the anterior ocellus, the interantennal region usually is not differentiated in color ventrally, the mesoscutum sometimes has an obscure coppery medial band extending posteriorly, and the scutellar-axillar complex is often entirely dark. Smaller females are somewhat less conspicuously setose than the holotype. Although the head of the non-allotype male is extensively reddish-coppery, it is quite distinctly green within the interocellar region and under some angles of light lateral to the anterior ocellus as well as ventrally on the parascrobal region, and the mesoscutum dorsally is also somewhat more extensively greenish. The fore wing of the non-allotype male is somewhat more extensively setose than for the allotype, but the basal fold and mediocubital folds are extensively bare so that the bare region of the disc along the basal fold is broadly continuous with the cubital area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Fig. 61</xref>).</p>

                        <p>Females vary in length from about 4.5–6 mm and males from about 3.8–4.2 mm. Females and males have a similar color pattern to the holotype and allotype though extent and intensity of the brown regions of the middle and hind legs are variable, the metafemur sometimes with up to about the apical half yellowish-orange and the metatibia sometimes being more or less entirely yellowish-orange. Intensity of the coppery region on the upper face in females is also somewhat variable, the upper arms sometimes not quite extending to the posterior ocelli or sometimes almost filling the interocellar triangle. Some females have the dorsomedial mesoscutal region dark without a distinct coppery luster, but the general color pattern is similar to that described for the holotype. Also, the combined notauli/anteroadmedian lines are often slightly depressed as well as having smaller reticulations and therefore are visible, though relatively obscurely so, as parallel paramedial lines over about the anterior two-thirds of the mesoscutum.</p>

                        <p>Because of a conspicuously elongate-slender gaster and syntergum, females of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota elongata</tp:taxon-name> are most similar to those of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota longiventris</tp:taxon-name>. However, the syntergum of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota elongata</tp:taxon-name> always has a distinct precercal portion, whereas this is usually lacking from <tp:taxon-name>Calosota longiventris</tp:taxon-name> because the penultimate tergum normally extends to or slightly posterior to the level of the cerci. Females of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota elongata</tp:taxon-name> also have much longer flagellomeres, a more distinctly bicolored mesoscutum (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figs 17, 18</xref>), the middle and hind legs always partly brown (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figs 36, 37</xref>), and the fore wings hyaline (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figs 36, 37</xref>). Males of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota longiventris</tp:taxon-name> differ from those of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota elongata</tp:taxon-name> most conspicuously by their shorter flagellomeres and more uniformly colored mesoscutum, but also by a more uniformly yellowish-orange middle leg (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Figs 44, 45</xref>).</p>

                        <p>Except for a comparatively longer marginal vein (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Figs 60, 62</xref>) and usually the absence of a differentiated M-like region on the upper face (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figs 2, 4</xref>), females of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota longivena</tp:taxon-name> are very similar to females of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota aestivalis</tp:taxon-name> that do not have obviously differentiated paramedial longitudinal bands on the mesoscutum (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 14</xref>). The fore wing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Fig. 62</xref>) is also hyaline and setose such that a distinct bare band adjacent to the basal fold is lacking, the stigmal vein is obtusely angled relative to the marginal vein so that the perpendicular distance from the apex of the stigmal vein to the wing margin is subequal to its length, the stigma is elongate-slender and evenly curved from the stigmal vein, fu1 is always less than twice as long as wide, and the syntergum is moderately elongate-slender. However, all of these latter characteristic features of female <tp:taxon-name>Calosota longivena</tp:taxon-name> appear to be variable among females I identify as <tp:taxon-name>Calosota aestivalis</tp:taxon-name> (see further under latter species).</p>

                        <p>As stated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Burks (1973)</xref>, the lectotype of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota longiventris</tp:taxon-name> is “fragmentary”, including about the apical half of the syntergum broken off and glued to the plastic point, to which separately are glued the remainder of the metasoma, leg parts, and the mesosoma plus head. The head lacks the left antenna beyond fu2 and the right antenna beyond fu6. However, the body parts remaining are sufficient to readily place the name, including the relatively short funiculars [fu1–fu6 = 13(9), 26(10), 27(10), 29(10), 29(10), 21(10)], conspicuously long syntergum, and yellowish-orange middle and hind legs. As noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Burks (1973)</xref>, the remaining fore wing is hyaline; additionally, the lectotype is one of few females observed with a line of setae separating the cubital area from the short bare region of the convex part of the mediocubital fold (most setae abraded but setal pattern indicated by sockets). The male paralectotype from the same locality has the same setal pattern, but I identify the male paralectotype from Argus Mts as a male of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota aestivalis</tp:taxon-name> based on leg color.</p>

                        <p>Females of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota longiventris</tp:taxon-name> are most similar to those of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota elongata</tp:taxon-name>, as discussed under the latter species. A few females of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota longiventris</tp:taxon-name> do not have the penultimate tergum extending to the level of the cerci so that there is a visible precercal portion of the syntergum similar to <tp:taxon-name>Calosota elongata</tp:taxon-name>, but this likely is an artifact of preservation in these very few females. The single female from Arizona (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Map 3</xref>) is unusually dark, lacking distinct metallic lusters except for on the interantennal region and scape, and having the legs except the tarsi mostly dark, but in other features is similar to typical <tp:taxon-name>Calosota longiventris</tp:taxon-name> from California. If males of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota longiventris</tp:taxon-name> from Arizona also have mostly dark legs, unlike those from California, they will closely resemble males of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota aestivalis</tp:taxon-name>. However, males of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota aestivalis</tp:taxon-name> have the ventrolateral arm of the coppery region below the anterior ocellus quite obviously contiguous with the inner orbit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 2</xref>), whereas typical males of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota longiventris</tp:taxon-name> from California have the arm separated from the inner orbit (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 5</xref>) and it is possible that dark males from Arizona may even lack the coppery region. Males of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota aestivalis</tp:taxon-name> also commonly have fu1 quite distinctly elongate, whereas fu1 is quadrate to slightly transverse in males of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota longiventris</tp:taxon-name>.</p>

                        <p>Noyes recorded <tp:taxon-name>Calosota viridis</tp:taxon-name> from North Africa and several countries in the Palaearctic region; I saw specimens that I identify as <tp:taxon-name>Calosota metallica</tp:taxon-name> from Bulgaria (BMNH, NMPC), Corsica (ZSMC), Cyprus (USNM), France (BMNH, CNC), Hungary (HNHM), Iran (CNC), Italy (BMNH, CNC, NMPC), Kyrgyzstan (UCRC), Romania (CNC), Sardinia (BMNH, NMPC), Slovakia (NMPC), Spain (BMNH, MNCN, NMPC) and Turkey (CNC). In North America, <tp:taxon-name>Calosota metallica</tp:taxon-name> occurs in southernmost British Columbia and throughout the USA west of the Rocky Mountains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Map 4</xref>), but undoubtedly extends also into northern Mexico. Its restricted distribution west of the Rocky Mountains and apparent close relationship with mo<!--PageBreak-->rphologically similar species in Europe (see below) suggest that it is of European origin and is not naturally Holarctic. Rather, its distribution and biology suggest that it likely was introduced accidentally into the USA, possibly California, by early settlers in straw.</p>

                        <p><tp:taxon-name>Calosota metallica</tp:taxon-name> is easily distinguished from other regional species based on its color and the presence of a large, broad, fore wing speculum that is completely bare or has at most a few widely separated setae within an obviously broad bare region that extends to the basal fold and parastigma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Fig. 59</xref>).</p>
                        <p>The apparent similarity between <tp:taxon-name>Calosota metallica</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Calosota viridis</tp:taxon-name> was first noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Bouček (1970)</xref> when he synonymized <tp:taxon-name>Calosota coerulea</tp:taxon-name> under <tp:taxon-name>Calosota viridis</tp:taxon-name> after examining type material of the latter two names. The synonymy of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota metallica</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Calosota viridis</tp:taxon-name> was also proposed to me by Dr. Lucian Fusu, Faculty of Biology, “Al. I. Cuza” University, Iasi, Romania, who sent me a female from Romania that he had identified as <tp:taxon-name>Calosota viridis</tp:taxon-name>. Although I have not examined the syntypic series of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota viridis</tp:taxon-name> I am confident in formally synonymizing <tp:taxon-name>Calosota viridis</tp:taxon-name> under <tp:taxon-name>Calosota metallica</tp:taxon-name> syn. n. based on the original description and figure of the fore wing given for <tp:taxon-name>Calosota viridis</tp:taxon-name> by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Masi (1922, fig. 1)</xref>, which shows the characteristic broad speculum of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota metallica</tp:taxon-name>. My synonymy of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota coerulea</tp:taxon-name> under <tp:taxon-name>Calosota metallica</tp:taxon-name> syn. n. follows <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Bouček (1970)</xref>.</p>
                        <p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Askew and Nieves-Aldry (2006)</xref> synonymized <tp:taxon-name>Calosota modesta</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Calosota matritensis</tp:taxon-name> Bolívar y Pieltain, both described from Spain, under <tp:taxon-name>Calosota viridis</tp:taxon-name>. <tp:taxon-name>Calosota modesta</tp:taxon-name> was based on a unique male holotype, which I examined (MNCN Cat. No. 42574), whereas <tp:taxon-name>Calosota matritensis</tp:taxon-name> was based on a female holotype and male allotype collected in Chamartín and seven female paratypes collected in Vaciamadrid. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Askew and Nieves-Aldry (2006)</xref> stated that they located the holotype, allotype, and six paratypes of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota matritensis</tp:taxon-name> in MNCN, but <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Martín Albaladejo and Izquierdo Moya (2006)</xref> reported only two female paratypes remained in MNCN. The MNCN curator of entomology was also able to find only two paratype females in response to my request to examine type material of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota matritensis</tp:taxon-name> (Mercedes Paris, personal communication). These two paratypes (MNCN Cat. No. 42521 and 42522) and the male holotype of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota modesta</tp:taxon-name> bear identical data labels with “Vaciamadrid, G. Mercet”. Female <tp:taxon-name>Calosota matritensis</tp:taxon-name> paratype 42522 is about 2.1 mm in length and has a broad fore wing speculum typical of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota metallica</tp:taxon-name>. It also has quite a bulbous clava that is about 1.6× as long as wide, about twice as wide as fu8, and about 3.2× as wide as fu2; fu2 is quadrate and the combined length of fu1 + fu2 is only slightly more than 0.6× the length of the pedicel. The second paratype (no. 42521) is slightly larger, about 2.3 mm in length, and has a more or less uniformly tapered (lanceolate) clava that is about twice as long as wide, about 1.4× as wide as fu8, and only about 2.3× as wide as fu2 (measurements taken from uncollapsed left clava); fu2 is about 1.3× as long as wide and the combined length of fu1 + fu2 is about 0.9× the length of the pedicel. This paratype also has the discal setae extending to the parastigma and basal fold, though this is not obvious because the setae below the submarginal vein are lighter in color than more apically and both fore wings beyond the level of the basal cell are glued to the card along with the ventrally mounted specimen. Otherwise, the two paratypes closely resemble each other and typical <tp:taxon-name>Calosota metallica</tp:taxon-name> females, including having a finely sculptured acropleuron (though largely concealed <!--PageBreak-->by glue and overhanging wings), about the apical one-fifth of the metatibiae yellowish, and the scape brownish-violaceous with the violaceous luster varying in strength depending on the angle of light.</p>
                        <p>Similar to <tp:taxon-name>Calosota matritensis</tp:taxon-name> female paratype 42521, the male holotype of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota modesta</tp:taxon-name> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 26</xref>) and another MNCN male with the same data but slightly different label than the holotype lack a broad fore wing speculum. The discal setae are yellowish-white and more difficult to differentiate below the submarginal vein, but they extend virtually to the basal cell with only quite a slender lunate bare region along the basal fold and extreme base of the mediocubital fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 25</xref>). The metatibiae are more widely yellowish in the holotype of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota modesta</tp:taxon-name> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 26</xref>) than in the non-type male or two <tp:taxon-name>Calosota matritensis</tp:taxon-name> paratypes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Askew and Nieves-Aldry (2006: 95)</xref> noted that the male holotype of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota modesta</tp:taxon-name> has “unusually coarse mesoscutal sculpture and rather dark coloration” compared to typical <tp:taxon-name>Calosota viridis</tp:taxon-name> males.</p>
                        <p>I saw 62 females from the European countries listed above that I assign to <tp:taxon-name>Calosota metallica</tp:taxon-name> based on a distinct fore wing speculum and other features typical for the species, though a few have the scape yellowish basally near the radicle and seven females collected from four different localities in Spain in 1973 and 1974 (NMPC) have a mostly yellowish scape that is slightly darkened only apically. The females I identify as <tp:taxon-name>Calosota metallica</tp:taxon-name> range in length from about 2−3.3 mm and all have quite a distinctly bulbous clava varying from about 1.4−1.9× as long as wide, about 1.6−2.3× as wide as the basal width of fu8, and about 2.8−3.8× as wide as fu2, and usually also have the apical subsegment angled to form quite a distinct oblique ventroapical margin compared to a more uniformly convex dorsal margin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Fig. 80</xref>). Furthermore, fu2 is about 1−1.3× as long as wide and the combined length of fu1 + fu2 is about 0.6−0.8× the length of the pedicel. Consequently, <tp:taxon-name>Calosota matritensis</tp:taxon-name> paratype 52522 falls within the range of what I identify as <tp:taxon-name>Calosota metallica</tp:taxon-name> from Europe. Another 13 females from Hungary (5♀ HNHM), Portugal (1♀ BMNH), Spain (1♀ BMNH, 1♀ MNCN), Sardinia (4♀ BMNH) and Yugoslavia (USNM) with a finely sculptured (coriaceous-alutaceous) acropleuron similar to <tp:taxon-name>Calosota metallica</tp:taxon-name> more closely resemble <tp:taxon-name>Calosota matritensis</tp:taxon-name> paratype 42521 because they have the discal setae extending variably conspicuously to the basal fold and parastigma. Individuals vary in length from about 3.2−5 mm and five of the 13 have at least the basal half of the scape yellowish. The five females with a broadly yellow scape vary in length from about 2.75−5 mm, and four of the five have entirely hyaline fore wings. Seven of the females have an entirely dark scape, including <tp:taxon-name>Calosota lixobia</tp:taxon-name> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Erdös (1946)</xref> paralectotype no. 6581 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 24</xref>) and 6583 (var. hyperparasita) (HNHM) that I examined. Females with a dark scape are about 4−5.8 mm in length and have the fore wing disc partially infuscate. The remaining female, the smallest (about 2.5 mm), has the outer surface of the scape dark but the inner surface more obviously brownish-yellow basally and the fore wings hyaline. The different females typically have uniformly yellowish to brown discal setae, though often the setae are at least partly whitish below the submarginal vein or at least the parastigma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 24</xref>). These females are usually much larger and/or have a darker body than those of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota metallica</tp:taxon-name> (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figs 22, 24</xref>), and sometimes have at least the basal half of the scape yellow and/or variably extensively infuscate fore<!--PageBreak--> wings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 24</xref>), but other than lacking a distinct fore wing speculum the only feature that appears to differentiate them consistently from <tp:taxon-name>Calosota metallica</tp:taxon-name> is flagellar structure. The clava ranges from about 1.5−1.9× as long as wide, but is less distinctly clavate than for <tp:taxon-name>Calosota metallica</tp:taxon-name> females, being about 1.2−1.5× as wide as fu8 and only about 1.5−2.4× as wide as fu2. Furthermore, fu2 ranges from about 1.3−1.8× as long as wide and the combined length of fu1 + fu2 is about 0.9−1.7× as long as the pedicel. Relative to smaller females, larger females tend to have the length of fu2 and the combined length of fu1 + fu2 compared to the pedicel longer. Except for its comparatively slender clava, most relative antennal dimensions for <tp:taxon-name>Calosota matritensis</tp:taxon-name> paratype 42521 are intermediate between that of typical <tp:taxon-name>Calosota metallica</tp:taxon-name> and the other larger females discussed above, which likely is correlated with its relatively small body size.</p>
                        <p>I also saw 23 European males (BMNH, MNCN, UCRC) that I assign to <tp:taxon-name>Calosota metallica</tp:taxon-name> because they have an obvious fore wing speculum. The visibility of the bare region is partly because it is quite broad but also because the discal setae are yellowish to brown rather than white. Another 16 males from Bulgaria, Sardinia, Yugoslavia (BMNH), Hungary (HNHM), and Spain (BMNH, MNCN) are similar to these males, including having the acropleuron finely sculptured, the scape entirely dark, the propodeal callus setose only anteriorly, and the flagellum robust-filiform (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Fig. 63</xref>). However, they have the discal setae extending variably densely to the basal fold and most have white (hyaline) and therefore comparatively inconspicuous fore wing setae.</p>
                        <p>In describing <tp:taxon-name>Calosota matritensis</tp:taxon-name>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Bolívar y Pieltain (1929)</xref> did not mention size of the specimens or the presence of a bare region below the base of the marginal vein and parastigma, but did describe fu1 (anellus) as being about two-thirds as long as fu2, fu2 about 1.25× as long as wide, the ultimate funicular almost quadrangular, and the clava distinctly wider than the funicle and slightly more than 1.5× as long as wide. All of these features are attributable to females of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota metallica</tp:taxon-name> and I therefore follow the conclusion of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Askew and Nieves-Aldry’s (2006)</xref>, who purportedly examined the holotype, that <tp:taxon-name>Calosota matritensis</tp:taxon-name> is a junior synonym of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota viridis</tp:taxon-name> and hence <tp:taxon-name>Calosota metallica</tp:taxon-name> syn. n. However, I believe that <tp:taxon-name>Calosota matritensis</tp:taxon-name> female paratype 42521 is the opposite sex of the male holotype of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota modesta</tp:taxon-name> and remove <tp:taxon-name>Calosota modesta</tp:taxon-name> from under synonymy with <tp:taxon-name>Calosota viridis</tp:taxon-name> stat. rev. Additional specimens collected in Spain and throughout Europe are needed to determine whether quite conspicuous differences in size, scape color, and other features of the 13 females discussed above represent intra- or interspecific variation and whether <tp:taxon-name>Calosota modesta</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Calosota lixobia</tp:taxon-name> are conspecific or represent distinct species.</p>
                        <p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Askew and Nieves-Aldrey (2006)</xref> synonymized <tp:taxon-name>Calosota lixobia</tp:taxon-name> under <tp:taxon-name>Calosota obscura</tp:taxon-name> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">Ruschka (1921)</xref> after examining the lectotype of the former name. In their key to females they differentiated <tp:taxon-name>Calosota obscura</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Calosota dusmeti</tp:taxon-name> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Bolívar y Pieltain (1929)</xref> from <tp:taxon-name>Calosota viridis</tp:taxon-name> partly by females having a “relatively strongly reticulately sculptured” acropleuron. As noted above, the acropleuron appears to be finely sculptured in the two female paratypes of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota lixobia</tp:taxon-name> that I examined, though the acropleura are largely concealed by the wings and glue on the card-mounted specimens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 24</xref>). A minutien-pinned male paralectotype (no. 6585) of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota lixobia</tp:taxon-name> I examined has both acropleura completely exposed and they are very shallowly reticulate to reticulate-coriaceous anterior to the <!--PageBreak-->microsculptured region and elongate coriaceous-alutaceous without any reticulations posteriorly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Fig. 57</xref>). I did not examine the remaining fragmentary type of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota dusmeti</tp:taxon-name> (MNCN) or that of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota obscura</tp:taxon-name> (NHMW), but was sent a dorsolateral habitus image of the holotype of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota obscura</tp:taxon-name>. I saw 15 females from France (CNC), Hungary (CNC, HNHM), Italy (BMNH), Spain (MNCN), and South Korea (CNC) that I identify as <tp:taxon-name>Calosota obscura</tp:taxon-name> based on absence of a fore wing speculum and presence of a meshlike reticulate acropleuron, including posterior to the microsculptured region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Fig. 56</xref>), as well as a completely dark scape and almost completely dark legs excluding the tarsi (knees and apices of at least pro- and metatibiae very narrowly yellow). Another 16 females from Italy (BMNH), Hungary (BMNH, HNHM), Libya (BMNH), Portugal (BMNH), Sardinia (BMNH), and Spain (BMNH, MNCN) are similar except for usually having the scape yellowish or at least quite obviously brownish basally rather than entirely dark, and the knees distinctly yellow if not the metatibia and often the mesotibia extensively light colored. The latter females would key to <tp:taxon-name>Calosota dusmeti</tp:taxon-name> using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Askew and Nieves-Aldrey (2006)</xref>. Similar to the females discussed above with a finely sculptured acropleuron, those with a more reticulate acropleuron and dark or partly yellowish scape can have entirely hyaline or partly infuscate fore wings. In addition to the females I saw 27 males from Bulgaria, France, Italy, Sardinia (BMNH) and Spain (BMNH, MNCN) that have the acropleuron finely reticulate anteriorly and meshlike reticulate-coriaceous posteriorly, and at least some of the flagellomeres noticeably separated by a short pedicel as keyed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Askew and Nieves-Aldry (2006)</xref> for males of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota obscura</tp:taxon-name>. All the males have a dark scape and I was unable to satisfactorily differentiate more than one species based on males. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Askew and Nieves-Aldrey (2006)</xref> suggested that <tp:taxon-name>Calosota dusmeti</tp:taxon-name> might be nothing more than a color form of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota obscura</tp:taxon-name>. The color variation observed for females, and all males being quite similar may support this hypothesis. If the “light colored” morphotype is a separate species from <tp:taxon-name>Calosota obscura</tp:taxon-name>, then its senior synonym likely is <tp:taxon-name>Calosota violascens</tp:taxon-name> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Masi (1922)</xref> rather than <tp:taxon-name>Calosota dusmeti</tp:taxon-name> based on the original description of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota violascens</tp:taxon-name>.</p>
                        <p>Interestingly, females of both the coriaceous and reticulate acropleuron morphotypes discussed above that resemble <tp:taxon-name>Calosota metallica</tp:taxon-name> to greater or lesser extent except for the absence of a broad speculum vary quite conspicuously in size and can have an entirely yellow to entirely dark scape and hyaline or partly infuscate fore wings. A comprehensive revision of Palaearctic <tp:taxon-name>Calosota</tp:taxon-name> is required to determine whether color and/or acropleural sculptural differences reflect intra- or interspecific variation and establish correct nomenclature. Because of acropleural sculpture I suspect that <tp:taxon-name>Calosota lixobia</tp:taxon-name> is not a synonym of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota obscura</tp:taxon-name> as proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Askew and Nieves Aldrey (2006)</xref>, but I do not reestablish <tp:taxon-name>Calosota lixobia</tp:taxon-name> because I did not examine the lectotype of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota lixobia</tp:taxon-name> or the holotype of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota obscura</tp:taxon-name> and because the validity of acropleural sculpture as opposed to color differences for differentiating species within the complex requires further study. Certainly, more than one species in a <tp:taxon-name>Calosota lixobia</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Calosota modesta</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Calosota violascens</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Calosota dusmeti</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Calosota obscura</tp:taxon-name> complex is indicated. For example, I saw three females from Greece (CNC) that have a coriaceous-alutaceous acropleuron and a basally yellow scape, but which have the propodeum very densely setose laterally and behind the spiracle to its inner<!--PageBreak--> margin so that the cuticle is largely obscured. Females discussed above with either a finely sculptured or reticulate acropleuron, regardless of scape color, have the propodeum setose ventrolaterally only to about the outer margin of the spiracle and more sparsely setose so that the cuticle is clearly visible. Four males from Cyprus (BMNH) likely represent the opposite sex of the females from Greece because they also have the propodeum quite densely setose to the posterior margin of the callus and medially to the level of the inner margin of the spiracle, whereas <tp:taxon-name>Calosota lixobia</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Calosota obscura</tp:taxon-name> males are similar to those of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota metallica</tp:taxon-name> in having the callus less densely setose and only over about its anterior half to two-thirds. However, one of the females I identify questionably as <tp:taxon-name>Calosota lixobia</tp:taxon-name> from Spain (BMNH) has the propodeal callus quite densely setose, though only to the outer margin of the spiracle.</p>
                        <p>Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Askew and Nieves-Aldrey (2006)</xref> did not formally synonymize the names, in the list of synonymy for <tp:taxon-name>Calosota viridis</tp:taxon-name> they included <tp:taxon-name>Calosota grylli</tp:taxon-name> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Erdös (1955)</xref> as a questionable synonym. <tp:taxon-name>Calosota grylli</tp:taxon-name> was described and subsequently keyed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Erdös (1960)</xref> as having a fore wing speculum similar to <tp:taxon-name>Calosota viridis</tp:taxon-name>, but the gaster almost twice as long as the combined length of the head and mesosoma (“3:5” according to original description) as compared to only slightly longer than the head and mesosoma in <tp:taxon-name>Calosota viridis</tp:taxon-name>. Because they considered relative gastral length to be variable, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Askew and Nieves-Aldrey (2006)</xref> listed <tp:taxon-name>Calosota grylli</tp:taxon-name> as a questionable synonym. I examined the lectotype female of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota grylli</tp:taxon-name> (NMPC, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 23</xref>)plus 12 other females that I identify as this species from Bulgaria and Yugoslavia (5 BMNH, 7 NMPC). Females of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota grylli</tp:taxon-name> are differentiated from those of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota metallica</tp:taxon-name> by having the metasoma about 1.9–2.1× as long as mesosoma, the syntergum obviously longer than wide (about 1.2–1.7× transcercal width) and, as noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Erdös (1960)</xref>, have white setae on the fore wing so that the setation is inconspicuous (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figs 22, 23</xref>).Females of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota metallica</tp:taxon-name> typically have more obvious setation because the setae usually are yellowish to brown, though rarely white. Furthermore, females of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota grylli</tp:taxon-name> differ quite conspicuously from those of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota metallica</tp:taxon-name> by having a yellowish tegula and quite a deep and distinct, circular pit within the scrobal depression at the dorsal level of the interantennal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 8</xref>) (normally concealed by the scapes). Females of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota metallica</tp:taxon-name> have at most a very shallow, vertical depression on the upper face (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figs 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">68</xref>). I also saw eight males from Bulgaria and Yugoslavia (1 BMNH, 7 NMPC) that I identify as <tp:taxon-name>Calosota grylli</tp:taxon-name>. These males have dark tegulae and the propodeal callus setose only anteriorly similar to those of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota metallica</tp:taxon-name>, but similar to <tp:taxon-name>Calosota grylli</tp:taxon-name> females have a circular depression on the upper face and white discal setae. Furthermore, the flagellum is quite distinctly clavate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Fig. 64</xref>), widening toward an obviously wider clava, with both fu1 and fu2 slightly longer than wide and fu8 somewhat transverse, and with the funiculars less conspicuously setose with less strongly curved setae than for males of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota metallica</tp:taxon-name> (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Figs 63, 64</xref>),as originally illustrated for the male paralectotype of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota grylli</tp:taxon-name> by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Erdös (1955, fig. 4e)</xref>.</p>
                        <p>Within the European material I examined I also saw 11 females from Spain (10 BMNH, 1 NMPC) that have a broad fore wing speculum, lack a pit on the upper face, and have a comparatively short gaster and syntergum similar to <tp:taxon-name>Calosota metallica</tp:taxon-name>. However, similar to <tp:taxon-name>Calosota grylli</tp:taxon-name> they have white discal setae and the tegula comparatively bright yel<!--PageBreak-->low except brown apically. The females also have at least the extreme base of the scape, but usually about its basal quarter and sometimes up to about its basal half yellow, and differ from both <tp:taxon-name>Calosota metallica</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Calosota grylli</tp:taxon-name> in having the mesoscutum quite densely and conspicuously setose (setae slightly lanceolate) compared to the scutellum, the head comparatively transverse (about twice as wide as long), the ocelli forming a more or less equilateral triangle (POL and LOL subequal), and the length of the flagellum + pedicel slightly shorter or at most equal to the width of the head. Females of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota metallica</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Calosota grylli</tp:taxon-name> have a somewhat more transverse quadrangular head (about 1.75–1.9× as wide as long), a flatter ocellar triangle (POL about 1.4–1.5× LOL) and a slightly longer flagellum + pedicle (about 1–1.1× width of the head). I also saw five males from Spain collected at the same time and place as some of the unidentified females. These males are similar to those of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota grylli</tp:taxon-name> in having white and therefore comparatively inconspicuous discal setae. However, unlike either <tp:taxon-name>Calosota metallica</tp:taxon-name> or <tp:taxon-name>Calosota grylli</tp:taxon-name> males, the propodeal callus is setose to its posterior margin at least laterally and at least about the basal half of the tegula is bright yellow. The flagellum is also only about 0.9× the width of head, fu1 and fu2 are both slightly transverse and of similar length, and fu8 is slightly but obviously transverse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Fig. 65</xref>). I consider these males as the opposite sex of this apparently undescribed species. Unlike females, the males do not have a basally yellow scape and though the mesoscutum is not as conspicuously setose as females the slightly lanceolate setae are more conspicuous than for males I identify as <tp:taxon-name>Calosota metallica</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Calosota grylli.</tp:taxon-name></p>

                        <p>FEMALE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 40</xref>). HOLOTYPE: length about 3.5 mm (mesonotum arched). Color. Head with frontovertex, parascrobal region and paraclypeal region dark brown with obscure reddish-violaceous sheen under some angles of light, scrobes and interantennal region to ventral margin of toruli dark or variably extensively bright violaceous-purple under some angles of light, and most of clypeal region and transverse band below toruli bluish-green. Maxillary and labial palpi dark. Antenna with scape brownish-yellow over almost basal quarter, otherwise dark brown with bluish-green lusters under some angles of light, pedicel with similar bluish-green luster, but flagellum dark brown. Tegula yellow. Mesonotum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 21</xref>) bright green with variable reddish-coppery reflections under different angles of light (frenal area concealed by dorsellum). Acropleuron greenish anteriorly similar to mesonotum, but grading to bluish-violaceous posteriorly. Legs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 40</xref>) with front leg extensively light brownish-yellow with knee and apex of tibia more distinctly yellow, but tibia subbasally and dorsally except for apex dark brown with greenish luster under some angles of light; middle leg<!--PageBreak--> yellowish beyond coxa except dorsal surface of tibia somewhat darker brownish-yellow at least subbasally; hind leg mostly yellowish beyond coxa, but femur more brownish, particularly ventrally, over about basal half and dorsal surface of tibia slightly brownish subapically. Fore wing hyaline; setae uniformly brown. Gaster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 40</xref>) mostly brown dorsally, but apex of penultimate tergum, syntergum more obscurely, and terga laterally bluish-green to violaceous.</p>
                        <p>Structure. Head in dorsal view about 1.9× as wide as long, with IOD about 0.4× head width; IOD: MPOD: OOL: POL: LOL = 55: 13: 8: 16: 10; in frontal view about 1.25× as wide as high, with about middle of torulus in line with lower orbits; malar space about 0.47× eye height. Head with frontovertex and parascrobal region meshlike coriaceous to about level of interantennal region, the sculpture more obscurely tapered ventrally between smooth and shiny scrobes and interantennal region dorsally, though interantennal region becoming increasingly more conspicuously coriaceous ventrally; clypeal region microcoriaceous and paraclypeal region mostly obliquely coriaceous-alutaceous, though paraclypeal region and lower parascrobal region smooth and shiny along inner orbit. Head with brownish setae except for bare scrobal depression. Antenna (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 40</xref>) with flagellum clavate; length of flagellum + pedicel about 1.5× as long as width of head; scape: pedicel: fu1–fu8: clava = 61(12): 23(10): 11(7), 16(8), 17(9), 18(9), 18(9), 15(9), 15(10), 15(13): 52(21). Mesoscutum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 21</xref>) strongly reticulate, the reticulations obviously larger medially than on lateral lobes but even largest reticulations very slightly concave rather than distinctly flat-bottomed, and with inconspicuous brownish setae; notaulus extending from spiracle as curved furrow on inclined anterior surface, without distinct anteroadmedian line and neither line extending posteriorly on dorsal surface; parapsidal line a more distinct microsculptured region. Axilla elongate-slender, separated by about 4× own width.

                        <p>Among the four species having a coriaceous frontovertex and extensively smooth and shiny scrobal depression (see under <tp:taxon-name>Calosota albipalpus</tp:taxon-name>), <tp:taxon-name>Calosota panamaensis</tp:taxon-name> is most similar to <tp:taxon-name>Calosota speculifrons</tp:taxon-name> (see further under latter species). It is quite possible that females collected in the future may have more extensively and conspicuously brown legs than the holotype. The short precercal portion of the syntergum of the holotype does not appear to be an artifact of preservation because it is as strongly and uniformly sculptured as the remainder of the syntergum.</p>

                        <title>Variation.</title>
                        <p>Females range in length from about 2.1–3.4 mm and males from about 2.1–2.6 mm. One exceptionally large female (FL: Cactus Hammock, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Fig. 51</xref>) has the<!--PageBreak--> head mostly dark brown except for slight coppery or greenish lusters under some angles of light and the mesosoma and gaster more or less uniformly reddish-coppery except for small greenish regions on the gastral terga dorsolaterally. The legs are almost completely yellow beyond the coxae, though with a similar color pattern to the holotype, and the outer surface of the metacoxa is much more densely and conspicuously setose. The mesoscutum is also more strongly reticulate with smaller reticulations so that they are more concave than flat-bottomed. The acropleuron is very shallowly reticulate-coriaceous anteriorly below the tegula and five curved setae project from under its posteroventral margin between the meso- and metacoxae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Fig. 51</xref>). The head also has the scrobal depression much more deeply concave; this apparently is because the face is collapsed below the anterior ocellus, but the vertex is not collapsed and the IOD is only one-third the width of the head. The ocelli are also relatively larger, with the IOD: MPOD: OOL: POL: LOL = 43: 13: 5: 14: 10. Additional specimens from Florida are necessary to better access variation, but I currently consider the Cactus Hammock female to be conspecific with the other female from Florida and those from the West Indies. Also, the single female and male from Dominican Republic differ from other type specimens in having a strongly bluish-green to purple mesosoma. The female has about the anterior third of the mesoscutum bright greenish (region narrowly blue posteriorly) and the posterior two-thirds violaceous to purple, the regions abruptly delimited posteriorly, whereas the scutellar-axillar complex is greenish-blue. The male has a more extensively bluish-green mesoscutum, including medially and very narrowly posteriorly, but the lateral lobes are partly violaceous to purple as for the female. The female has only the extreme base of the scape white, whereas the male lacks a distinct basal white region from the scape; the male also has the posterior surface of the profemur darker than for other males and with a slight purple luster. I interpret these differences as intraspecific variation, but additional specimens from Dominican Republic are required to better evaluate the color differences.</p>

                        <p>Females range in length from about 2.5–4.9 mm and males from about 1.25–2.75 mm. Females other than the holotype lack the metallic spot below the anterior ocellus, the purple luster of the face is sometimes less conspicuous though the interantennal region is always purple under some angles of light, and the mesofemur usually is quite dark brown except yellowish basally and apically. Both sexes sometimes have the mesoscutum more extensively coppery-brown (purplish-coppery in one female) with only the inclined surface laterally being partly bluish-purple to entirely greenish-purple. Males sometimes have the palpi light rather than dark brown. The scutellum of larger individuals is more distinctly strigose-reticulate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Fig. 78</xref>) than for smaller specimens, which have a more elongate-reticulate sculpture more similar to the mesoscutal sculpture medially, though always with much more elongate and smaller reticulations. Males typically have the metacoxa almost completely bare mediolongitudinally. All females have fu1 and fu8 at least slightly longer than wide, whereas the apical funiculars can be quadrate to slightly transverse in males, and both sexes can have the postmarginal vein shorter relative to the stigmal vein than described for the holotype and allotype.</p>
                        <p>I exclude from the type series one female and one male from Brazil that are very similar to other specimens I include in <tp:taxon-name>Calosota speculifrons</tp:taxon-name> except that the posterior, metallic colored part of the lateral lobes is reticulate in the female and the male has the lateral lobes entirely reticulate. The tips of the antennae are missing from the female, but the male has longer flagellomeres than those from Costa Rica such that the length of the flagellum + pedicel is almost 1.65× as long as the width of the head. Additional specimens from Brazil are necessary to better evaluate species limits. Another female from Nova Teutonia not listed above that bears the same data as the male, except it was collected 2.XII.40 (CNC), more certainly represents an undescribed species. It is about 6.2 mm in length and has about the basal half of the scape, tegula and legs yellow; the mesonotal sculpture and color pattern is similar to <tp:taxon-name>Calosota speculifrons</tp:taxon-name> but the lateral lobes and part of the mesoscutum dorsally is bright green rather than bluish or purple, as is also the face below about the level of the dorsal limit of the interantennal region. Furthermore, the face above the toruli is entirely, finely coriaceous except for separate smooth and shiny scrobes.</p>

                        <p>Among the four regional species having a coriaceous frontovertex and extensively smooth and shiny scrobal depression (see under <tp:taxon-name>Calosota albipalpus</tp:taxon-name>), <tp:taxon-name>Calosota speculifrons</tp:taxon-name> is most similar to <tp:taxon-name>Calosota panamaensis</tp:taxon-name> because they share dark palpi and an exposed, setose lower mesepimeron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Fig. 53</xref>). However, the two species are readily differentiated by mesonotal color and, most conspicuously, a different sculpture pattern of the scutellum relative to the mesoscutum. Individuals of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota speculifrons</tp:taxon-name> have the most darkly colored legs of the four species with a similar head sculpture, the mesofemur at least being extensively brownish-yellow if not dark brown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figs 20</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">50</xref>).</p>
                        <p>My association of males and females of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota speculifrons</tp:taxon-name> is based largely on individuals of both sexes having dark palpi and an exposed, setose lower mesepimeron, but this association requires confirmation through rearing or collecting both sexes in either North America or Costa Rica. Unlike other North American species with a similar head sculpture, males I assign to <tp:taxon-name>Calosota speculifrons</tp:taxon-name> have a clavate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figs 29</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">50</xref>) rather than an elongate-filiform, setose flagellum (<tp:taxon-name>Calosota albipalpus</tp:taxon-name>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Fig. 48</xref> and <tp:taxon-name>Calosota setosa</tp:taxon-name>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Fig. 47</xref>). Furthermore, I saw two males from Dominican Republic (CNC) that I do not assign to any species or describe as new that are similar to males I identify as <tp:taxon-name>Calosota speculifrons</tp:taxon-name> except they have white palpi and lack an exposed lower mesepimeron, similar to <tp:taxon-name>Calosota albipalpus</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Calosota setosa</tp:taxon-name>.</p>

                        <p>Additional features than those used in the key to differentiate <tp:taxon-name>Calosota vernalis</tp:taxon-name> relative to <tp:taxon-name>Calosota aestivalis</tp:taxon-name> are provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Graham (1969)</xref>, including comparatively narrower axillae and the acropleuron anteriorly being obliquely coriaceous-alutaceous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Fig. 54</xref>) rather than at least shallowly meshlike reticulate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Fig. 55</xref>). If eventually collected in North America, individuals of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota vernalis</tp:taxon-name> are most likely to be misidentified as one of the four regional species having a conspicuously sculptured scrobal depression, but unlike any of these species lack an exposed lower mesepimeron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Fig. 54</xref>). It also uniquely has an unusual sculpture combination of a finely meshlike coriaceous frontovertex and more coarsely reticulate or at least transversely sculptured scrobal depression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figs 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">69</xref>). This not only helps differentiate it from <tp:taxon-name>Calosota aestivalis</tp:taxon-name>, which has both the frontovertex and scrobal depression reticulate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 2</xref>), but also from the nominal European species <tp:taxon-name>Calosota agrili</tp:taxon-name> Nikol’skaya (1952) (paratype examined, BMNH), <tp:taxon-name>Calosota bolivari</tp:taxon-name> Askew (2006) (holotype examined, MNCN) and <tp:taxon-name>Calosota nitens</tp:taxon-name> Askew (2006) (holotype and paratype examined, MNCN), which have the frontovertex coriaceous and the scrobal depression mostly smooth and shiny similar to the New World albipalpus species-group (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figs 9, 10</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">66</xref>).</p>
                        <p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Askew and Nieves-Aldrey (2006)</xref> noted that the unknown male of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota nitens</tp:taxon-name> may have the antennal features that they used to differentiate males of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota vernalis</tp:taxon-name>. The male<!--PageBreak--> of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota nitens</tp:taxon-name> is undescribed and I have not seen any males resembling females of the species. However, based on the two examined type females from Spain and one additional female from Sardinia (BMNH), in addition to having the outer surface of the metacoxa entirely setose, females of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota nitens</tp:taxon-name> uniquelyhave the propodeal callus setose along the propodeal foramen. Other <tp:taxon-name>Calosota</tp:taxon-name> typically have the callus setose lateral to the spiracle and sometimes there are 1 or 2 setae behind the spiracle but never along the propodeal foramen. The male of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota nitens</tp:taxon-name> may also have the propodeum at least sparsely setose along the foramen and if so should be recognized easily.</p>
                        <p>Although the male of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota bolivari</tp:taxon-name> is also undescribed, I saw 19 males and 3 females from Spain (CNC, MNCN), 13 males and 3 females from Cyprus (CNC), and 1 male from Corsica (ZSMC) that I identify as this species. The combination of head sculpture (upper part of scrobal depression at most finely coriaceous rather than obviously reticulate) and exposed, lunate lower mesepimeron differentiate the males from those of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota aestivalis</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Calosota vernalis</tp:taxon-name>, respectively. Flagellar structure of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota bolivari</tp:taxon-name> males is somewhat similar to that of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota vernalis</tp:taxon-name>, but the funiculars are typically shorter and the setae are conspicuously longer and more distinctly curved, the setae projecting at an obtuse angle and curved so as to be subparallel with the funicular distally. Using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Askew and Nieves-Aldrey (2006)</xref>, the putative males of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota bolivari</tp:taxon-name> key to <tp:taxon-name>Calosota obscura</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Calosota aestivalis</tp:taxon-name>, but the flagellum is comparatively more gracile with abutting funiculars unlike that described for <tp:taxon-name>Calosota obscura</tp:taxon-name>, and the acropleuron is finely coriaceous. Of the six females examined, one (El Ventorrillo, 14.VII.91, A. Garrido) was identified as <tp:taxon-name>Calosota dusmeti</tp:taxon-name> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Askew and Nieves-Aldrey (2006)</xref>. This apparent misidentification likely was in part because it has about the basal two-thirds of the scape yellowish-orange, unlike the holotype of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota bolivari</tp:taxon-name> which has an entirely dark scape, but similar to specimens of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota dusmeti</tp:taxon-name>. However, scape color of other females from Spain and Cyprus, which vary in length from about 2.4−5 mm, varies from entirely or virtually entirely dark to variably extensively yellowish. These females are also very similar to the paratype of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota agrili</tp:taxon-name> examined, which has about the basal half of the right scape yellowish and the left scape quite dark with only some indication of yellow in its basal half. Another female from Voronezhskaya Oblast, Russia (CNC), identified as <tp:taxon-name>Calosota agrili</tp:taxon-name> by A. Sharkov has both scapes dark. All the females have the marginal vein about 2.8× as long as the stigmal vein and the carina along the propodeal foramen not quite extending to the anterior margin of the propodeum so that there is a very short medial plical region similar to the holotype of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota bolivari</tp:taxon-name>. The holotype was described as having the medial length of the propodeum (including plical region and smooth and shiny lunate region posterior to carina extending anteriorly from along foramen) as long as the dorsellum, but this is partly an artifact because the mesonotum is arched and the anterior margin of the propodeum extends over the apex of the dorsellum to reduce its apparent length. Based on the above, I suspect that <tp:taxon-name>Calosota bolivari</tp:taxon-name> is a junior synonym of <tp:taxon-name>Calosota agrili</tp:taxon-name>, but hesitate to formalize the synonymy prior to a more comprehensive revision of Palaearctic <tp:taxon-name>Calosota</tp:taxon-name>.</p>
