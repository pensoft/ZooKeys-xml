                <p>The history of the classification of the <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> (<tp:taxon-name>Diptera</tp:taxon-name>) is traced from Meigen to the present. The contributions of Robineau-Desvoidy, Townsend, Villeneuve, Mesnil, Herting, Wood and many others are discussed within a chronological, taxonomic, and geographic context. The gradual development of the <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> into its modern concept as a family of the <tp:taxon-name>Oestroidea</tp:taxon-name> and the emergence of the classificatory scheme of tribes and subfamilies in use today are reviewed. Certain taxa that have in the past been difficult to place, or continue to be of uncertain affinity, are considered and some are given in a table to show their varied historical treatments. The more significant systematic works published on the <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> in recent decades are enumerated chronologically.</p>

            <title>Introduction</title>
            <p>The <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> are among the largest families of <tp:taxon-name>Diptera</tp:taxon-name> with about 8500 valid species<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN1">1</xref>. One can only guess at the true diversity of the family but at least double the num<!--PageBreak-->ber of valid species is a conservative estimate. What is not in doubt is the important ecological role these parasitoid flies play in the environment. It is desirable to organize these flies into a phylogenetically stable suprageneric classification as an aid to those who study them and to enable predictions to be made about the less studied species based on the known habits of related species.</p>
            <p>The <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> may not be the single largest family of flies on Earth but in terms of genera they tower over all of the other 140-odd families. The current number of valid genera is about 1520 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">O’Hara 2012</xref>). The next largest family is <tp:taxon-name>Cecidomyiidae</tp:taxon-name> with about 760 genera and there are only two other families with more than 500 genera: <tp:taxon-name>Asilidae</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Chironomidae</tp:taxon-name> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B82">Pape et al. 2011</xref>). Taxonomically the <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> are arguably the most difficult family of flies and perhaps because of this plus the size of the family and their high position on the evolutionary tree of <tp:taxon-name>Diptera</tp:taxon-name> they have received scant attention below the family level by those investigating dipteran relationships (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B126">Yeates et al. 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Kutty et al. 2010</xref>). There is currently an international effort aimed at addressing this imbalance by specifically targeting the <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> for phylogenetic analysis using morphological and molecular data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B100">Stireman et al. 2013</xref>).</p>
            <p>It seems appropriate at this time to review the history of tachinid classification from its earliest beginnings, tracing how it has changed in response to discoveries of phylogenetically insightful characters and was affected by conflicting views on the nature of generic and suprageneric limits. The noticeable disharmony in the way tachinids were classified among the six biogeographic regions of the world is still in evidence today. The task that now awaits present and future tachinidologists is to determine to a better degree than in the past the evolutionary history of the <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> and to classify the family in a manner than reflects its phylogeny and preserves the best elements of the most recent classifications.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec sec-type="The early years">
            <title>The early years</title>
            <p>The meagre number of tachinid species known in the early 1800s was placed in about a dozen genera with the majority of them in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">Meigen’s (1803)</xref> broadly defined <!--PageBreak--><italic><tp:taxon-name>Tachina</tp:taxon-name></italic><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN2">2</xref>. André-Jean-Baptiste Robineau-Desvoidy revolutionized tachinid classification with the publication of his <italic>Essai sur les Myodaires</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">Robineau-Desvoidy 1830</xref>), in which approximately 130 new genera now placed in <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> were described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Evenhuis et al. 2010</xref>). Of this total, 73 genera are presently treated as valid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">O’Hara 2012</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">Robineau-Desvoidy (1830)</xref> also proposed the name “<tp:taxon-name>Calypteratae</tp:taxon-name>” (<tp:taxon-name>Calyptratae</tp:taxon-name>) for a higher group within his <tp:taxon-name>Myodaria</tp:taxon-name> (essentially modern-day <tp:taxon-name>Schizophora</tp:taxon-name>), which with some modification in concept (most notably the addition of the <tp:taxon-name>Anthomyiidae</tp:taxon-name>) is now regarded as “one of the best established monophyletic subsections of the <tp:taxon-name>Schizophora</tp:taxon-name>” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">McAlpine 1989</xref>: 1425). In this same work, Robineau-Desvoidy’s six tribes of <tp:taxon-name>Calypteratae</tp:taxon-name> approximated some of the familial and subfamilial groupings in use today in this subsection. One of these, the <tp:taxon-name>Entomobiae</tp:taxon-name> (including most of the then-known taxa of the <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name>), included a small number of genera grouped under the <tp:taxon-name>Tachinariae</tp:taxon-name>. The priority of the name <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> over other family-group names available for this family thus dates from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">Robineau-Desvoidy (1830)</xref>.</p>
            <p>The <italic>Essai sur les Myodaires</italic> was not without its faults and received mixed reviews from dipterists of the day. Robineau-Desvoidy’s final contribution to dipterology, a massive two-volume work published in 1863 and six years after his death, <italic>Histoire naturelle des diptères des environs de Paris</italic>, has been justly criticized as an inferior work. In it were proposed about 160 new tachinid genera, only 25 of which are currently recognized as valid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">O’Hara 2012</xref>). Similarly, a huge number of new species were described with many of them later becoming junior synonyms or <italic>nomina dubia</italic> (the latter resulting from the destruction of many of Robineau-Desvoidy’s name-bearing types, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Evenhuis et al. 2010</xref>: 233).</p>
            <p>Contemporaneous with Robineau-Desvoidy were Meigen, Wiedemann, Macquart and Walker, each of whom contributed significantly to the description of species but not much to the higher classification of what are now the <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name>. Macquart (e.g., <italic>Diptères exotiques nouveaux ou peu connus</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">1838–1855</xref>), like Robineau-Desvoidy, recognized the need for more genera to accommodate the emerging diversity and throughout his career described about 100 tachinid genera, of which 45 are currently valid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">O’Hara 2012</xref>).</p>
            <p>The study of <tp:taxon-name>Diptera</tp:taxon-name> during the mid to late 1800s continued to be led by Europeans. Among the more notable achievements during this time were the regional treatments on the <tp:taxon-name>Diptera</tp:taxon-name> of Scandinavia by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B127">Zetterstedt (1842–1860)</xref>, on Italian <tp:taxon-name>Diptera</tp:taxon-name> by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">Rondani (1856–1880)</xref>, and on Austrian <tp:taxon-name>Diptera</tp:taxon-name> by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B93">Schiner (1860–1864)</xref>. A most ambitious and influential work on the <tp:taxon-name>Diptera</tp:taxon-name> of the Vienna Museum by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Brauer and Bergenstamm (1889–1895)</xref> contributed greatly to the knowledge of world <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name>, but was marred by an unsatisfactory and artificial suprageneric classification (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Coquillett 1897</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Aldrich 1905</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B118">Villeneuve 1924</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B120">Wainwright 1928</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">Mesnil 1944</xref>). Brauer and Bergenstamm described over 250 genera and subgenera of <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name>, of which 99 are currently valid genera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">O’Hara 2012</xref>).</p>
            <p>New World tachinids came under increased attention near the turn of the century, first by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B125">van der Wulp (1888–1891)</xref> and then by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Coquillett (1897)</xref>. Commenting on the state of tachinid classification at the time, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Coquillett (1897: 27)</xref> noted:</p>
            <p>“Probably no single family of <tp:taxon-name>Diptera</tp:taxon-name> has received greater consideration in Europe than the <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name>, and yet, strange as this may seem, no other family at the present time is in greater disorder. Several authors accord them only subfamily rank, but it appears desirable to consider them as a distinct family, although their relationship to the <tp:taxon-name>Dexidae</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Sarcophagidae</tp:taxon-name> is a very intimate one.”</p>
            <p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Coquillett (1897)</xref> recognized five subfamilies of <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name>, four representing present-day <tp:taxon-name>Phasiinae</tp:taxon-name> and one (his <tp:taxon-name>Tachininae</tp:taxon-name>) representing modern <tp:taxon-name>Exoristinae</tp:taxon-name> + <!--PageBreak--><tp:taxon-name>Tachininae</tp:taxon-name>. No tribes were recognized. The “<tp:taxon-name>Dexidae</tp:taxon-name>” (<tp:taxon-name>Dexiidae</tp:taxon-name>) were regarded as a separate family and excluded.</p>
            <p>Despite the chaotic state of tachinid classification in the late 1800s, an important methodological advance was made in the study of dipteran characters that would lead to a better understanding of natural groupings within the higher <tp:taxon-name>Diptera</tp:taxon-name>. Early authors like Meigen, Macquart and Robineau-Desvoidy had used certain large setae in their descriptions but it was Rondani (1845) who would apply the term macrochaetae (as “macrochetae”) to them. Later <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">Osten Sacken (1881</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">1884</xref>) would formalize a nomenclature for such macrochaetae under the term chaetotaxy. With refinements of the system by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Girschner (1893</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">1896</xref>), the study of chaetotaxy began to revolutionize the study of the more setose <tp:taxon-name>Diptera</tp:taxon-name>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">Osten Sacken (1884: 511)</xref> had observed that the “hypopleural” (meral) setae “occur only in some of the <tp:taxon-name>Diptera</tp:taxon-name> Calyptrata, which have a row or a tuft of them” and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">Girschner (1893)</xref> used this characteristic to define the <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> in the broad sense of present-day <tp:taxon-name>Oestroidea</tp:taxon-name>. Girschner also recognized several subgroups within <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> <italic>s. lat.</italic> based on other setal arrangements. The classification was not completely satisfactory and it was only later that the enlarged subscutellum would be used to delimit the <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> in a more modern sense (see below). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Frey (1921)</xref> built upon the work of Girschner to further advance the classification of this group of flies.</p>
            <p>By the beginning of the 20th Century the taxonomic literature on Palaearctic <tp:taxon-name>Diptera</tp:taxon-name> was both voluminous and daunting, especially for new students of the group. The <italic>Katalog der paläarktischen Dipteren</italic> (1903–1907) was therefore of immense importance, bringing together under a single classification all the names of Palaearctic <tp:taxon-name>Diptera</tp:taxon-name>. The part by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Bezzi and Stein (1907)</xref> on the <tp:taxon-name>Schizometopa</tp:taxon-name> relied heavily on the work of Girschner and proposed a higher classification of considerable merit for its day. The <tp:taxon-name>Schizometopa</tp:taxon-name> were split into two families, <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> and “<tp:taxon-name>Anthomyidae</tp:taxon-name>” (<tp:taxon-name>Anthomyiidae</tp:taxon-name>) (present-day <tp:taxon-name>Muscoidea</tp:taxon-name>). Within <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name>, ten subfamilies were recognized and listed in the following order: <tp:taxon-name>Tachininae</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Dexiinae</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Rhinophorinae</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Sarcophaginae</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Calliphorinae</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Phasiinae</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Eginiinae</tp:taxon-name>, “<tp:taxon-name>Hypoderminae</tp:taxon-name>” (<tp:taxon-name>Hypodermatinae</tp:taxon-name>), <tp:taxon-name>Oestrinae</tp:taxon-name> and “<tp:taxon-name>Gastrophilinae</tp:taxon-name>” (<tp:taxon-name>Gasterophilinae</tp:taxon-name>). With the exception of the <tp:taxon-name>Eginiinae</tp:taxon-name> (now placed in <tp:taxon-name>Muscidae</tp:taxon-name>), the rest of the groups with some adjustment to relative ranking closely approximates the families now recognized in the <tp:taxon-name>Oestroidea</tp:taxon-name>.</p>
            <p>Although the <italic>Katalog der paläarktischen Dipteren</italic> must have been a most welcome addition to the shelf of any dipterist of the day, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">Mesnil (1944: 2)</xref> later criticized the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Bezzi and Stein (1907)</xref> portion on the grounds that it was “voll von Irrtümern und praktisch unverwendbar” [“full of mistakes and practically unusable”].</p>
            <sec sec-type="Classifying New World Tachinidae">
                <title>Classifying New World <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name></title>
                <p>North American <tp:taxon-name>Diptera</tp:taxon-name> were first catalogued by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">Osten Sacken (1858)</xref> and the few tachinid genera listed therein were included in the <tp:taxon-name>Muscidae</tp:taxon-name>. In the second edition of his catalogue, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">Osten Sacken (1878)</xref> revised the classification of <tp:taxon-name>Diptera</tp:taxon-name> and recognized <!--PageBreak-->both the <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> and “<tp:taxon-name>Dexidae</tp:taxon-name>” (<tp:taxon-name>Dexiidae</tp:taxon-name>) as families. The next catalogue was that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Aldrich (1905)</xref>, and although the <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Dexiidae</tp:taxon-name> were kept separate following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">Osten Sacken (1878)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Coquillett (1897)</xref>, the suggestion was made that they might be better combined. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Aldrich (1905)</xref> followed the order of genera of <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> given by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">Coquillett (1897)</xref> and interpolated additional genera and species as necessary. Disparaging remarks were made about the monographic works of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B125">van der Wulp (1888–1891)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Brauer and Bergenstamm (1889–1895)</xref>, and of the species descriptions of Bigot (“in every way objectionable, almost always referred to the wrong genus, and seldom containing the essential data”, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Aldrich 1905</xref>: 420).</p>
                <p>Charles Henry Tyler Townsend, the most eccentric and prolific of all tachinidologists, published his first paper on tachinids in 1891 and his last in 1944, with almost 500 publications in total (the majority on tachinids) over this long period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Arnaud 1958</xref>). He took up the study of insects at the age of 10 and the study of flies at 25. He held a variety of jobs and professional appointments in the United States and later Peru before settling in Brazil for the last 25 years of his life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B110">Townsend 1943</xref>). His most significant achievement was the <italic>Manual of Myiology</italic>, a 12-volume series on the “<tp:taxon-name>Oestromuscaria</tp:taxon-name>” published between 1934–1942 in which virtually every genus of these flies known at the time was placed in a suprageneric classification and given a detailed description.</p>
                <p>Townsend was, by his own admission, a splitter of taxa. He was well versed in the works of others and offered this historical perspective on the struggle between “radicalism and conservatism” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B109">Townsend 1935</xref>: 37):</p>
                <p>“History shows that the taxonomy of these flies has suffered much in the making, subjected as it has been for the past century to an alternation of radicalism and conservatism, commonly called splitting and lumping. … Desvoidy, the first radical, employed restricted genera and Macquart, the first conservative, lumped them; Róndani again restricted the genera and Schiner lumped them; Brauer &amp; Bergenstamm split, while Coquillett and Aldrich lumped; Villeneuve and Townsend again split, while Curran and Malloch lumped.”</p>
                <p>The restricted genera of Townsend were based on the author’s concept of a “physiological genus”, defined as a “natural genus” comprising “all those species which can produce fertile crosses” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B109">Townsend 1935</xref>: 38). As noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">van Emden (1945: 389–390)</xref>, “the adoption of [this] principle implies the application of the generic unit to every unit considered to be a species in general zoological practice”. One can learn, explained <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B109">Townsend (1935: 56)</xref>, “to make a complete description of a fly genus and its genotype [type species] in one hour for one sex and an hour and a half for both sexes”. The ideal number of members within each of the categories of genus, tribe, family, suborder and order was set at five (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B109">Townsend 1935</xref>: 60–61). In practise Townsend rarely included more than one species per genus and throughout his career described 1491 genera and 1555 species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Arnaud 1958</xref>), with approximately 85% of the genera belonging to the <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name>. The number of valid tachinid genera attributed to Townsend currently <!--PageBreak-->stands at 544 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">O’Hara 2012</xref>), more than five times that of any other author. Second place is held by Robineau-Desvoidy with 104 valid genera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">O’Hara 2012</xref>).</p>
                <p>Townsend’s methods and productivity are worth more than a cursory mention because this author has, in some ways, done more to retard tachinid taxonomy than advance it. The sheer volume of genera is one problem, and their assignment to suprageneric categories is another. Townsend knew that females of <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> and related families possess a great diversity of reproductive systems that produce different kinds of eggs and larvae. After 25 years of dissecting specimens and studying the female reproductive system, he was able to recognize 36 distinct groups, most pertaining to present-day <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B107">Townsend 1934</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B109">Townsend (1935: 38)</xref> believed that tachinid relationships had proved to be a “Gordian knot” in the past and:</p>
                <p>“not until the wonderful diversity of female reproductive characters and early stages was demonstrated did any sword for the cutting of this knot appear. … We are now able to determine actual relationships with greater certainty, having found the key to affinities by correlating external anatomic characters with internal reproductive and early stage characters.”</p>
                <p>Thus armed with internal, external and larval characters, Townsend developed a unique classification that divided present-day <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> among seven families (<tp:taxon-name>Gymnosomatidae</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Oestridae</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Prosenidae</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Rutiliidae</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Dexiidae</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Exoristidae</tp:taxon-name>) and about 90 tribes. Had this hierarchical system truly classified the <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> along phylogenetic lines then it would have been the most significant advance in the history of tachinidology. However, it fell short of this goal and is now regarded as both unmanageable and artificial (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Mesnil 1939</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B122">Wood 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B123">1987</xref>). Specialists also found the keys to tribes and genera in <italic>Manual of Myiology</italic> to be fraught with problems, thus hindering the recognition of Townsend’s supraspecific taxa.</p>
                <p>William Robin Thompson published a series of eight papers in the <italic>Tachinids of Trinidad</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B103">Thompson 1961–1968</xref>). He had difficulty interpreting the fauna of Trinidad according to the Townsend scheme and chose to avoid attempting to revise Townsend’s genera:</p>
                <p>“[I have] decided also that in most cases an attempt to simplify the taxonomic problems by reducing Townsendian genera to the synonymy is impracticable because with the knowledge we now have it is impossible to know when to stop” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B102">Thompson 1961</xref>: 22).</p>
                <p>Thompson found the works of Mesnil and other Europeans (see below) more helpful than the works of Townsend for understanding the major groupings of <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name>. Although this led Thompson to classify the <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> of Trinidad in a more natural way, he had a proclivity for describing unnecessary new genera.</p>
                <p>The tribes, genera and species created by Townsend were described predominantly for New World taxa and by their sheer number continue to pose serious challenges <!--PageBreak-->for taxonomists to this day. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B91">Sabrosky and Arnaud (1965)</xref>, the first to catalogue the <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> of America north of Mexico in the post-Townsend era, adopted a nearly modern concept of the family (differing only by the inclusion of <tp:taxon-name>Rhinophorinae</tp:taxon-name>) while otherwise retaining many of Townsend’s tribes:</p>
                <p>“for present convenience, in the absence of any other published arrangement of the Nearctic genera, though with some combinations and generic transfers, notably where we agree with the recent work of Mesnil and coworkers in Europe. This is especially true in the <tp:taxon-name>Goniinae</tp:taxon-name> [= <tp:taxon-name>Exoristinae</tp:taxon-name>]” (p. 962).</p>
                <p>The catalogue of the <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> of America south of the United States by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Guimarães (1971)</xref> followed shortly after Thompson’s <italic>Tachinids of Trinidad</italic> and Sabrosky and Arnaud’s catalogue. This author, faced with the huge number of tribes, genera and species described by Townsend and having to deal with other taxa inadequately described by earlier authors, could not revise the whole classification and mostly followed Townsend. This action, he admitted, resulted in a “catalogue arrangement [that] leaves much to be desired” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Guimarães 1971</xref>: 3). The rich fauna of the region was catalogued into 2864 species and (by Guimarães’ own admission) an over-split 944 genera.</p>
                <p>There have been to date only two major attempts to correct the generic imbalance that has impeded study of New World <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name>, both by Donald Montgomery Wood. The first was a conspectus of the <tp:taxon-name>Blondeliini</tp:taxon-name> of North and Central America and the West Indies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B122">Wood 1985</xref>). Although this study excluded South American <tp:taxon-name>Blondeliini</tp:taxon-name>, it nevertheless reduced the number of valid genera from about 230 to 55. Many of the genera sunk into synonymy were Townsend’s but there were also many described by Reinhard, Thompson, Curran and others. The second work to reduce the number of New World genera was <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B123">Wood’s (1987)</xref> <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> chapter in <italic>Manual of Nearctic Diptera</italic>. The nomenclatural changes in this work, including almost 200 new generic synonyms, were later enumerated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">O’Hara and Wood (1998)</xref>.</p>
                <p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B123">Wood (1987)</xref> also successfully bridged the gap between the generic classifications of the Nearctic and Palaearctic regions created by Townsend some decades earlier. This was accomplished partly by reducing the number of genera but also by assessing genera from a Holarctic perspective. The catalogue by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">O’Hara and Wood (2004)</xref> further united the classifications of Nearctic and Palaearctic <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name>. The catalogue by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Guimarães (1971)</xref> has not been updated and the 800+ genera currently recognized in America south of the United States will not be easily converted into a modern classification. A careful study of the name-bearing types of the type species of many of these genera will be necessary before a better classification can be constructed for Neotropical <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name>.</p>

                <title>The European influence</title>
                <p>The Europeans of the early 1900s continued to build on the discoveries of Girschner and others at the same time that Townsend in the New World was pursuing his own course <!--PageBreak-->of investigations that would culminate in his <italic>Manual of Myiology</italic>. Joseph Villeneuve de Janti, a medical doctor by profession (like Robineau-Desvoidy), emerged as an early specialist on the <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> and published actively on the family from 1900 until his death in 1944. He wrote an influential paper in 1924 reviewing earlier works on chaetotaxy and detailing his own views on characters useful for understanding the evolution of the “Myodaires supérieurs”. This group comprised the “Tachinaires” (<tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> <italic>sensu</italic> present-day <tp:taxon-name>Oestroidea</tp:taxon-name>) and “Anthomyaires” (<tp:taxon-name>Anthomyiidae</tp:taxon-name> <italic>sensu</italic> present-day <tp:taxon-name>Muscoidea</tp:taxon-name>). Within Villeneuve’s <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> were <tp:taxon-name>Calliphorinae</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Sarcophaginae</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Dexiinae</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Rhinophorinae</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Phasiinae</tp:taxon-name>, and <tp:taxon-name>Tachininae</tp:taxon-name>. Particularly noteworthy and progressive was the division of the <tp:taxon-name>Tachininae</tp:taxon-name> into two groups, <tp:taxon-name>Eutachininae</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Protachininae</tp:taxon-name>, of which the former was considered more evolved than the latter. As a rough approximation, the two correspond to present-day <tp:taxon-name>Exoristinae</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Tachininae</tp:taxon-name>, respectively.</p>
                <p>Villeneuve was well respected by contemporaries for his expertise in <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> and willingly shared his knowledge with others. As noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B120">Wainwright (1928: 141)</xref>, Villeneuve:</p>
                <p>“has contributed largely towards the reduction to something like order of our knowledge of these insects. Possibly the full value of his services to science may never be appreciated, because so many of the fruits of his labours have been given to the world by other workers, whom he has unselfishly and ungrudgingly assisted”.</p>
                <p>The discovery by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">Malloch (1923)</xref> that the <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Dexiidae</tp:taxon-name> can be distinguished from <tp:taxon-name>Sarcophagidae</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Calliphoridae</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Muscidae</tp:taxon-name> by an enlarged “metanotum” (subscutellum) was a highly significant development in the classification and differentiation of these flies. It was likely this discovery that led <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B119">Villeneuve (1933)</xref> to revise his earlier classification and divide the “Tachinaires” into three groups:</p>
                <p>1) <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> with <tp:taxon-name>Phasiinae</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Dexiinae</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Tachininae</tp:taxon-name>,</p>
                <p>2) <tp:taxon-name>Sarcophagidae</tp:taxon-name> with <tp:taxon-name>Miltogramminae</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Sarcophaginae</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Calliphorinae</tp:taxon-name>, and</p>
                <p>3) <tp:taxon-name>Rhinophoridae</tp:taxon-name>, a small group of isopod parasitoids.</p>
                <p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B119">Villeneuve (1933)</xref> treated the <tp:taxon-name>Eutachininae</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Protachininae</tp:taxon-name> of the <tp:taxon-name>Tachininae</tp:taxon-name> at length.</p>
                <p>Villeneuve was a mentor and friend of Louis Paul Mesnil, who was 36 years his junior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">Mesnil 1950</xref>). It was originally Villeneuve who was invited by Lindner to author the <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> volumes of his ambitious <italic>Die Fliegen der palaearktischen Region</italic> (hereafter <italic>FPR</italic>). However, as the project drew closer Villeneuve realized that the talented and younger Mesnil was a better choice to take on this demanding and long-term task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Herting 1987</xref>).</p>
                <p>Mesnil was an avid student of <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name>. He demonstrated his enthusiasm and insight early by publishing, as one of his first works on the group, a lengthy treatise entitled <!--PageBreak--><italic>Essai sur les Tachinaires</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Mesnil 1939</xref>). He began the <italic>Essai</italic> by reviewing and critiquing the classifications of his more illustrious predecessors: Robineau-Desvoidy, Macquart, Meigen, Rondani, Brauer and Bergenstamm, Pandellé, and Girschner. In proposing a new classification, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Mesnil (1939)</xref> drew special inspiration from the works of Robineau-Desvoidy and Villeneuve, and like Brauer and Bergenstamm, started by grouping together related genera and building the classification “depuis la base vers le sommet” [“from the base to the summit”] (p. 20).</p>
                <p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Mesnil (1939)</xref> restricted the term Tachinaires to the family <tp:taxon-name>Larvaevoridae</tp:taxon-name><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN3">3</xref> (i.e., <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name>). The main diagnostic feature of the family was the well-developed “postscutellum” (subscutellum), as previously implied in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B119">Villeneuve’s (1933)</xref> classification and explicitly adopted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Curran (1934</xref>, as “metanotum”). Mesnil relegated the <tp:taxon-name>Rhinophorinae</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Sarcophaginae</tp:taxon-name> to the <tp:taxon-name>Calliphoridae</tp:taxon-name> and subdivided the <tp:taxon-name>Larvaevoridae</tp:taxon-name> into six subfamilies: <tp:taxon-name>Salmaciinae</tp:taxon-name><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN4">4</xref>, <tp:taxon-name>Phorocerinae</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Larvaevorinae</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Ameniinae</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Dexiinae</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Phasiinae</tp:taxon-name> (including <tp:taxon-name>Oestrini</tp:taxon-name>). These were keyed and characterized and most were further subdivided.</p>
                <p>The <tp:taxon-name>Phorocerinae</tp:taxon-name> of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Mesnil (1939)</xref> consisted of tachinids possessing a haired prosternum and a small “prealar” (postsutural supraalar) seta. Included within the <tp:taxon-name>Phorocerinae</tp:taxon-name> were three tribes: <tp:taxon-name>Phorocerini</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Blondeliini</tp:taxon-name>, and <tp:taxon-name>Crocutini</tp:taxon-name><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN5">5</xref>. The <tp:taxon-name>Phorocerini</tp:taxon-name>, with vein M (as “4<sup>e</sup>”) having an angular bend and a shadow fold, and the <tp:taxon-name>Blondeliini</tp:taxon-name>, with vein M having a rounded bend and no shadow fold, and both possessing divergent subapical scutellar setae (convergent in <tp:taxon-name>Crocutini</tp:taxon-name>), have continued to the present virtually unchanged in their characterization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B121">Wood 1972</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B122">1985</xref>). The <tp:taxon-name>Phorocerini</tp:taxon-name> have since become known as the <tp:taxon-name>Exoristini</tp:taxon-name>.</p>
                <p>Mesnil began publishing <italic>FPR</italic> instalments a few years after his <italic>Essai</italic>. The goal was to treat all of the Palaearctic <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> to species level but the task proved too great for him alone. After 35 years and some 1500 pages of text, the <tp:taxon-name>Larvaevorinae</tp:taxon-name> (present-day <tp:taxon-name>Exoristinae</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Tachininae</tp:taxon-name>) were completed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">Mesnil 1944–1975</xref>) along with one instalment on the <tp:taxon-name>Dexiinae</tp:taxon-name> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">Mesnil 1980</xref>). Herting planned to publish on the remainder of the <tp:taxon-name>Dexiinae</tp:taxon-name> and all of the <tp:taxon-name>Phasiinae</tp:taxon-name> but only one instalment on the latter was published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Herting 1983</xref>).</p>
                <p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">Mesnil’s (1944)</xref> first instalment for <italic>FPR</italic> began, as did his <italic>Essai</italic>, with general remarks about previous workers and their classifications. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">Mesnil (1944: 2)</xref> made these observations about the generic concepts of other workers:</p>
                <p>“Oft auch haben sie alte künstliche Gattungen aufrechterhalten, deren Umfang jedes Maß überschreitet und deren Heterogenität offenkundig ist; können sie doch sogar Arten verschiedener Tribus enthalten.</p>
                <!--PageBreak-->
                <p>So lassen sich die meisten neuzeitlichen Dipterologen, da sie die wahren Merkmale der Tachinen zu wenig berücksichtigt haben, nach zwei Richtungen gruppieren: die einen unterteilen die Gattungen bis ins Unendliche und machen so fast alle monospezifisch (T. Townsend), die andern vereinigen zahlreiche Gattungen zu einem Ganzen und gelangen so zu monströsen Zusammenfassungen (Curran).”</p>
                <p>[“Often, they have maintained old artificial genera whose scope exceeds all bounds and whose heterogeneity is obvious; even though they may contain species of different tribes.</p>
                <p>Since most modern dipterists have not taken the true characteristics of tachinids into account, they can be grouped in two directions: some subdivide the genera into infinity and thus make almost all of them monospecific (T. Townsend), others unite numerous genera into a whole and arrive at monstrous compilations (Curran)”.]</p>
                <p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Lindner (1933)</xref> established the classification of the <tp:taxon-name>Diptera</tp:taxon-name> that would be followed in <italic>FPR</italic> six years before <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Mesnil’s (1939)</xref> <italic>Essai</italic>. This constrained <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">Mesnil (1944)</xref> into keeping <tp:taxon-name>Larvaevoridae</tp:taxon-name> in the older and broader sense of present-day <tp:taxon-name>Oestroidea</tp:taxon-name> instead of in the restricted sense of present-day <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name>. Recognized within <tp:taxon-name>Larvaevoridae</tp:taxon-name> were subfamilies <tp:taxon-name>Larvaevorinae</tp:taxon-name> (with tribes <tp:taxon-name>Salmaciini</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Phorocerini</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Larvaevorini</tp:taxon-name>), <tp:taxon-name>Dexiinae</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Phasiinae</tp:taxon-name>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Mesnil’s (1939)</xref> <tp:taxon-name>Oestrini</tp:taxon-name> (then placed in <tp:taxon-name>Phasiinae</tp:taxon-name>) became the “<tp:taxon-name>Gastrophilinae</tp:taxon-name>” (<tp:taxon-name>Gasterophilinae</tp:taxon-name>), <tp:taxon-name>Oestrinae</tp:taxon-name> and “<tp:taxon-name>Hypoderminae</tp:taxon-name>” (<tp:taxon-name>Hypodermatinae</tp:taxon-name>) of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Lindner (1933)</xref>. It is clear that this higher classification did not appeal to Mesnil. To him, the true definition of the <tp:taxon-name>Larvaevoridae</tp:taxon-name> was undeniable (“unbestreitbare”) and based on the enlarged subscutellum and parasitic habits of the family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">Mesnil 1944</xref>). His only recourse was to chart the classification he would have followed had he been permitted to do so (numbers in parentheses refer to Lindner’s numbering system for families) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">Mesnil 1944</xref>: 20):</p>

                <p>The Lindner series was published in small instalments (“Lieferungen”), the length of each being determined by the number of printed signatures used per instalment. <!--PageBreak-->Frequently an instalment would end in the middle of a description or in the middle of a key. This may have been cost-effective for the publisher but created havoc nomenclaturally. New generic names, for example, were often <italic>nomina nuda</italic> in one instalment and not made available until years later in another instalment. A great number of such nomenclatural issues as they pertain to the <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> were dealt with by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">O’Hara (1996)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Evenhuis and O’Hara (2008)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Evenhuis et al.

                <p>Mesnil’s <italic>FPR</italic> instalments by definition dealt primarily with the Palaearctic fauna but incorporated information on the taxa of other regions, except for the nearly impenetrable taxa of Neotropical <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name>. The result, in concert with a great many papers published by Mesnil outside <italic>FPR</italic>, was a classification for the bulk of the <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> that could be hailed by contemporaries as a leap forward in the quest for a scheme reflecting the true relationships of the family. The suprageneric classification of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B108">Townsend (1934–1942)</xref> was largely ignored by Europeans who were making progress through their own investigations.</p>
                <p>The first of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">Mesnil’s (1944)</xref> instalments in <italic>FPR</italic> gave only a glimpse of the classification that would follow. The <tp:taxon-name>Ameniinae</tp:taxon-name> were transferred to the <tp:taxon-name>Calliphoridae</tp:taxon-name> and kept as a subfamily, although the family itself is not currently considered monophyletic (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">Rognes 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Kutty et al. 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">Mesnil’s (1944)</xref> three tribes of <tp:taxon-name>Larvaevorinae</tp:taxon-name> were split over the duration of <italic>FPR</italic> into a number of subtribes: nine in <tp:taxon-name>Salmaciini</tp:taxon-name>, six in <tp:taxon-name>Phorocerini</tp:taxon-name> and over 40 in <tp:taxon-name>Larvaevorini</tp:taxon-name>. The <tp:taxon-name>Larvaevorini</tp:taxon-name> were revisited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">Mesnil (1966)</xref> and reclassified as <tp:taxon-name>Tachinini</tp:taxon-name> <italic>s. str.</italic> and <tp:taxon-name>Voriini</tp:taxon-name>. All of the subtribes of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">Mesnil (1944–1975)</xref> are now generally tribes and tribe <tp:taxon-name>Larvaevorini</tp:taxon-name> is present-day <tp:taxon-name>Tachininae</tp:taxon-name>. Many of the tribes continue to this day virtually unchanged whereas a few have undergone dramatic restructuring in the light of subsequent discoveries. The most significant changes resulted from research on the female postabdomen by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Herting (1957)</xref> and male genitalia by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B115">Verbeke (1962a)</xref>.</p>
                <p>Benno Herting began his career on <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> much the same way as did Mesnil (and even Robineau-Desvoidy) with an early publication based on original and extensive research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Herting 1957</xref>). It was a study of the female postabdomen and was based on the examination of about 500 species of calyptrate flies. Information about eggs and first instar larvae were taken into account but unlike Townsend’s studies the focus was more on the morphology of the terminal segments of the postabdomen than on the internal reproductive system. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Herting (1957)</xref> used his findings to characterize the structural features of the female postabdomen throughout the families, subfamilies and lower groups of the <tp:taxon-name>Calyptratae</tp:taxon-name>. He tried to interpret these findings in a phylogenetic context and to adjust the classification accordingly.</p>
                <p>Five subfamilies of the <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> were recognized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Herting (1957)</xref>: <tp:taxon-name>Echinomyiinae</tp:taxon-name><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN6">6</xref>, <tp:taxon-name>Dexiinae</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Phasiinae</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Ocypterinae</tp:taxon-name><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN7">7</xref>, and <tp:taxon-name>Eutachininae</tp:taxon-name>. At a gross level, <tp:taxon-name>Echinomyiinae</tp:taxon-name> corresponded to the <tp:taxon-name>Protachininae</tp:taxon-name> of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B118">Villeneuve (1924</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B119">1933</xref>) and to the <!--PageBreak--><tp:taxon-name>Larvaevorinae</tp:taxon-name> of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Mesnil (1939</xref>; and later, <tp:taxon-name>Larvaevorini</tp:taxon-name> of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">Mesnil 1966–1975</xref>); <tp:taxon-name>Ocypterinae</tp:taxon-name> was formerly treated within <tp:taxon-name>Phasiinae</tp:taxon-name> by both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B118">Villeneuve (1924</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B119">1933</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Mesnil (1939)</xref>; and <tp:taxon-name>Eutachininae</tp:taxon-name> was proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B118">Villeneuve (1924)</xref> and corresponded to the <tp:taxon-name>Salmaciinae</tp:taxon-name> (-ini) and <tp:taxon-name>Phorocerinae</tp:taxon-name> (-ini) of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Mesnil (1939</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">1944</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Herting (1957)</xref> treated the <tp:taxon-name>Oestridae</tp:taxon-name> as a separate family.</p>
                <p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Herting (1957)</xref> followed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B118">Villeneuve (1924</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B119">1933</xref>) in using the subfamily name <tp:taxon-name>Eutachininae</tp:taxon-name> in his classification. He subdivided this subfamily into the <tp:taxon-name>Goniini</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Eutachinini</tp:taxon-name>. He could not find reliable characters in the female postabdomen to separate these tribes and therefore chose to organize his discussion according to the reproductive habits of the species. Oviparous species were placed in the <tp:taxon-name>Eutachinini</tp:taxon-name> and distributed mostly between the <italic><tp:taxon-name>Winthemia</tp:taxon-name></italic> Robineau-Desvoidy group and <italic><tp:taxon-name>Eutachina</tp:taxon-name></italic><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN8">8</xref> Brauer and Bergenstamm group. These were essentially the <tp:taxon-name>Winthemiina</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Phorocerina</tp:taxon-name> that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">Mesnil (1944)</xref> had placed in tribes <tp:taxon-name>Salmaciini</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Phorocerini</tp:taxon-name>, respectively. Ovolarviparous species grouped by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">Mesnil (1944)</xref> in the <tp:taxon-name>Blondeliina</tp:taxon-name> (tribe <tp:taxon-name>Phorocerini</tp:taxon-name>) were also assigned to the <tp:taxon-name>Eutachinini</tp:taxon-name>. The ovolarviparous <italic><tp:taxon-name>Siphona</tp:taxon-name></italic> Meigen group (<tp:taxon-name>Siphonina</tp:taxon-name>, tribe <tp:taxon-name>Phorocerini</tp:taxon-name>, of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">Mesnil 1944</xref>) was more clearly defined but its placement in <tp:taxon-name>Eutachinini</tp:taxon-name> or <tp:taxon-name>Goniini</tp:taxon-name> was not discussed. Similarly, the “<italic><tp:taxon-name>Ethylla</tp:taxon-name></italic>” (<italic><tp:taxon-name>Ethilla</tp:taxon-name></italic>) Robineau-Desvoidy group was included in <tp:taxon-name>Eutachininae</tp:taxon-name> but its further placement was not discussed. No members of the <tp:taxon-name>Acemyina</tp:taxon-name> (tribe <tp:taxon-name>Phorocerini</tp:taxon-name>) of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">Mesnil (1944)</xref> were studied by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Herting (1957)</xref>.</p>
                <p>The composition of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Herting’s (1957)</xref> <tp:taxon-name>Goniini</tp:taxon-name> consisted of species with two reproductive modes. One is quite specialized and involves the production of tiny (microtype) eggs that females oviposit on the food plants of hosts. These eggs hatch only after ingestion by a potential host. This sort of egg and the biology associated with it were already well known as a result of earlier studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B92">Sasaki 1887</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B105">Townsend 1908</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B106">1911</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">Pantel 1910</xref><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN9">9</xref>). The rest of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Herting’s (1957)</xref> <tp:taxon-name>Goniini</tp:taxon-name> were mostly ovolarviparous species with a few oviparous species. This broad concept of the <tp:taxon-name>Goniini</tp:taxon-name> was essentially the <tp:taxon-name>Salmaciinae</tp:taxon-name> (-ini) of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Mesnil (1939</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">1944</xref>) without <tp:taxon-name>Ethyllina</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Winthemiina</tp:taxon-name>.</p>
                <p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Herting (1957)</xref> introduced an important change to the placement of the <tp:taxon-name>Voriini</tp:taxon-name>. The members of this tribe had been included in the <tp:taxon-name>Protachininae</tp:taxon-name> of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B118">Villeneuve (1924</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B119">1933</xref>) and the nearly equivalent <tp:taxon-name>Larvaevorinae</tp:taxon-name> of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Mesnil (1939)</xref>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Herting (1957)</xref> placed the tribe in the <tp:taxon-name>Dexiinae</tp:taxon-name>, bringing to three the number of Palaearctic tribes recognized in the subfamily: <tp:taxon-name>Dexiini</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Voriini</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Dufouriini</tp:taxon-name>. This move was supported by female postabdominal characters and by features of the male genitalia communicated to Herting by Verbeke (see below).</p>
                <p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">Mesnil (1956–1965)</xref> published on the <tp:taxon-name>Phorocerini</tp:taxon-name> in <!--PageBreak--><italic>FPR</italic> over a ten-year period.

He had already revised the Old World <tp:taxon-name>Phorocerina</tp:taxon-name> (as <tp:taxon-name>Phorocerini</tp:taxon-name>) in a separate publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">Mesnil 1946</xref>) that he had probably begun before starting <italic>FPR</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">Mesnil (1956–1965)</xref> was halfway through the <tp:taxon-name>Phorocerini</tp:taxon-name> when Herting published his next great work on the <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name>, a monograph on the biology of the West Palaearctic species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Herting 1960</xref>). This work had a different focus from his earlier study but included a hierarchical arrangement of taxa that the former work had lacked. A clear classification was in evidence and although it was congruent in many respects with Mesnil’s it differed from it in some significant ways. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Herting (1960)</xref> proposed a major restructuring of Mesnil’s <tp:taxon-name>Salmaciini</tp:taxon-name> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">Mesnil 1944–1956</xref>) and <tp:taxon-name>Phorocerini</tp:taxon-name> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">Mesnil 1956–1965</xref>). Both were united to form the <tp:taxon-name>Exoristinae</tp:taxon-name><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN10">10</xref>, consisting of a broadly defined <tp:taxon-name>Goniini</tp:taxon-name> (see above), <tp:taxon-name>Ethillini</tp:taxon-name> (Mesnil’s <tp:taxon-name>Ethyllina</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Atylomyina</tp:taxon-name>), and the following tribes that corresponded to Mesnil’s remaining subtribes (except for the mixed and non-Palaearctic <tp:taxon-name>Neominthoina</tp:taxon-name>): <tp:taxon-name>Winthemiini</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Exoristini</tp:taxon-name> (Mesnil’s <tp:taxon-name>Phorocerina</tp:taxon-name>), <tp:taxon-name>Blondeliini</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Acemyiini</tp:taxon-name>, and <tp:taxon-name>Siphonini</tp:taxon-name>.</p>

This work was published after <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Mesnil (1939)</xref> but before the <italic>FPR</italic> instalments on the same group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">Mesnil 1966–1975</xref>, as “<tp:taxon-name>Larvaevorini</tp:taxon-name> oder <tp:taxon-name>Tachinini</tp:taxon-name>”). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Mesnil (1939)</xref> had treated this group as the <tp:taxon-name>Larvaevorinae</tp:taxon-name> and noted that it was very close to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B119">Villeneuve’s (1933)</xref> <tp:taxon-name>Protachininae</tp:taxon-name> except for the exclusion of section <italic><tp:taxon-name>Winthemia</tp:taxon-name></italic> (placed by Mesnil in <tp:taxon-name>Salmaciinae</tp:taxon-name> [= Villeneuve’s <tp:taxon-name>Eutachininae</tp:taxon-name>], as <tp:taxon-name>Winthemiini</tp:taxon-name>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Mesnil’s (1939)</xref> <tp:taxon-name>Larvaevorinae</tp:taxon-name> had consisted of eight tribes<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN11">11</xref>: <tp:taxon-name>Campylochaetini</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Athryciini</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Larvaevorini</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Rhamphinini</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Leskiini</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Minthoini</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Thelairini</tp:taxon-name>, and <tp:taxon-name>Macquartiini</tp:taxon-name>.

The <tp:taxon-name>Microphthalmini</tp:taxon-name> of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Herting (1960)</xref> were moved to the <tp:taxon-name>Tachininae</tp:taxon-name> from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Mesnil’s (1939)</xref> section <tp:taxon-name>Dexiosomina</tp:taxon-name> (<tp:taxon-name>Dexiini</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Dexiinae</tp:taxon-name>).</p>
                <p>At the same time that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">Mesnil (1956–1965)</xref> was working through the <tp:taxon-name>Phorocerini</tp:taxon-name> using external characters and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Herting (1957</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">1960</xref>) was studying the female postabdomen, Jean <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B115">Verbeke (1962a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B116">1962b</xref><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B117">1963</xref>) was investigating tachinid male genitalia. Verbeke was communicating some of his findings to Herting before publishing them himself, thus contributing at least to Herting’s concept of the <tp:taxon-name>Dexiinae</tp:taxon-name> (see above). Verbeke (op. cit.) recognized within the complexity of the male genitalia a few general “types” associated with three structures. Firstly, the connection between the basiphallus and distiphallus is either “direct and non-mobile” (type I) or “indirect and <!--PageBreak-->mobile” (type II). Secondly, the distiphallus either lacks (POS [= <italic><tp:taxon-name>Phasia</tp:taxon-name></italic>, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Ocyptera</tp:taxon-name></italic>, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Strongygaster</tp:taxon-name></italic>] type) or possesses (DEG [= <italic><tp:taxon-name>Dexia</tp:taxon-name></italic>, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Echinomyia</tp:taxon-name></italic>, <italic><tp:taxon-name>Gonia</tp:taxon-name></italic>] type) longitudinal ventral microstructures. Thirdly, the “posterior paramere” (pregonite) has three types: type A, lobe-like and sensorial; type B, intermediate; and type C, strap-like and connective. These structural types do not form unique combinations and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B117">Verbeke (1963: 4)</xref> understood that “this repeated appearance of similar structures in different groups implicates a parallelism between the male genitalia of these groups”. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B115">Verbeke (1962a)</xref> concluded that the <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> were best divided into six subfamilies: <tp:taxon-name>Phasiinae</tp:taxon-name> were characterized on the basis of a POS type distiphallus, whereas other <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> have a DEG type distiphallus; <tp:taxon-name>Echinomyiinae</tp:taxon-name> (i.e., <tp:taxon-name>Tachininae</tp:taxon-name>) and <tp:taxon-name>Eutachininae</tp:taxon-name> (i.e., <tp:taxon-name>Exoristinae</tp:taxon-name>) have a type I connection between basiphallus and distiphallus; <tp:taxon-name>Dexiinae</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Voriinae</tp:taxon-name> have a type II connection between basiphallus and distiphallus; and <tp:taxon-name>Dufouriinae</tp:taxon-name> with tribes <tp:taxon-name>Macquartiini</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Dufourini</tp:taxon-name>, the former with a type I connection between the basiphallus and distiphallus and the latter with a type II connection but both tribes having a pregonite of type B. The subfamily <tp:taxon-name>Dufouriinae</tp:taxon-name> was clearly one of convenience and was not thought to be monophyletic. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B117">Verbeke (1963: 3)</xref> noted:</p>
                <p>“Many other characters prove the intermediate situation of both tribes [intermediate between <tp:taxon-name>Dexiinae</tp:taxon-name>-<tp:taxon-name>Voriinae</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Echinomyiinae</tp:taxon-name>-<tp:taxon-name>Eutachininae</tp:taxon-name>, see illustration in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B115">Verbeke (1962a: 147)</xref>] and for this reason we fused them into a new subfamily”.</p>
                <p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Herting (1957</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">1960</xref>) was aware of Verbeke’s studies on the male genitalia in advance of the publications on this subject (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B115">Verbeke 1962a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B117">1963</xref>) and was also familiar with the pioneering work on male genitalia by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B88">Rubtzov (1951)</xref>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Herting (1957)</xref> discovered that features in the female postabdomen—and corroborated by evidence from the male postabdomen—supported a new concept of the <tp:taxon-name>Dexiinae</tp:taxon-name>. The <tp:taxon-name>Dexiini</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Voriini</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Dufouriini</tp:taxon-name> were brought together to form the <tp:taxon-name>Dexiinae</tp:taxon-name>. Although this classification differed from the one proposed later by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B115">Verbeke (1962a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B117">1963</xref>), it can be seen that Verbeke’s type II phallus and type C pregonite accurately defines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Herting’s (1957</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">1960</xref>) <tp:taxon-name>Dexiinae</tp:taxon-name>.

                <p><tp:taxon-name>Goniini</tp:taxon-name> (<italic>s. str.</italic>) + <tp:taxon-name>Eryciini</tp:taxon-name> of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">Mesnil (1975a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">1975b</xref>) corresponded to <tp:taxon-name>Goniini</tp:taxon-name> (<italic>s. lat.</italic>) + <tp:taxon-name>Winthemiina</tp:taxon-name> + <tp:taxon-name>Ethillina</tp:taxon-name> of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Herting (1960)</xref>. Mesnil’s restriction of the <tp:taxon-name>Goniini</tp:taxon-name> to microovolarviparous tachinids was a key development in the classification of the <tp:taxon-name>Exoristinae</tp:taxon-name>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Herting (1984)</xref> would later remove the <tp:taxon-name>Winthemiina</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Ethillina</tp:taxon-name> from <tp:taxon-name>Eryciini</tp:taxon-name> and treat them as tribes of <tp:taxon-name>Exoristinae</tp:taxon-name>, thereby creating a concept of <tp:taxon-name>Goniini</tp:taxon-name> <italic>s. str.</italic> + <tp:taxon-name>Eryciini</tp:taxon-name> equaling that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Herting’s (1960)</xref> <tp:taxon-name>Goniini</tp:taxon-name>.</p>
                <p>The microovolarviparous tachinids had been recognized informally as a natural group within a broader <tp:taxon-name>Goniini</tp:taxon-name> since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Herting’s (1957)</xref> study of the female postabdomen. A few years later <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Herting (1960)</xref> again grouped these tachinids as the “Mikroovipare Arten” within his broadly defined <tp:taxon-name>Goniini</tp:taxon-name>. Herting was known to be in favour of classifying the <tp:taxon-name>Goniini</tp:taxon-name> in a more restricted sense even before this was proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">Mesnil (1975a)</xref>. Very likely the idea was more his than Mesnil’s, although the two colleagues surely discussed the issue and may have influenced each other in how best to classify these tachinids. What is known is that Herting corresponded with others about his thoughts on this suprageneric complex prior to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">Mesnil (1975a)</xref> publishing on it. This is evident in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Crosskey’s (1973b: 77)</xref> comments on the tribal classification he was adopting for Australian <tp:taxon-name>Goniinae</tp:taxon-name> (i.e., <tp:taxon-name>Exoristinae</tp:taxon-name>):</p>
                <p>“Herting (personal communication) considers that the multifarious genera of the <tp:taxon-name>Goniini</tp:taxon-name>-<tp:taxon-name>Carceliini</tp:taxon-name>-<tp:taxon-name>Sturmiini</tp:taxon-name>-<tp:taxon-name>Eryciini</tp:taxon-name> complex should be aggregated into two tribes (for which the names <tp:taxon-name>Eryciini</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Goniini</tp:taxon-name> would be nomenclaturally correct) according to whether they have an ovolarviparous or a microoviparous reproductive habit. Such a course has much to commend it insofar as it would probably reflect the real phylogeny more accurately than the present tribal system. But it is impossible to adopt such a system as yet for the Australian fauna, in which the reproductive habit of most of the genera remains unstudied.”</p>
                <p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B104">Thompson (1963)</xref>, based on his own study of innumerable dissections, also recognized the microovolarviparous tachinids as a distinct group and devoted a separate part of <italic>Tachinids of Trinidad</italic> to the “goniines with microtype eggs”. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B103">Thompson (1963: 258)</xref> noted: “In the classification of Townsend, species producing microtype eggs are scattered through at least 14 tribes: <tp:taxon-name>Eriothrixini</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Compsilurini</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Phoroceratini</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Phorinini</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Actiini</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Hyperecteinini</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Frontinini</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Goniini</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Belvosiini</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Harrisiini</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Sturmiini</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Lydellini</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Phrynoini</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Trypherini</tp:taxon-name>.”</p>
                <p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B91">Sabrosky and Arnaud (1965)</xref> (see also above) were caught between the Townsend legacy of New World tachinid taxonomy and the rapidly evolving views on tachinid relationships and classification of the European specialists Mesnil, Herting and Verbeke. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B91">Sabrosky and Arnaud (1965)</xref> recognized both the <tp:taxon-name>Goniini</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Eryciini</tp:taxon-name> but neither tribe corresponded very closely to the <tp:taxon-name>Goniini</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Eryciini</tp:taxon-name> later defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">Mesnil (1975a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">1975b</xref>).</p>
                <!--PageBreak-->
                <p>There was no Palaearctic catalogue of <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> published between those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Bezzi and Stein (1907)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Herting (1984)</xref>. Authors in the Old World wishing to treat regional faunas during this period were given overviews of emerging classifications first by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B118">Villeneuve (1924</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B119">1933</xref>) and then by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Mesnil (1939</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">1944–1975</xref>), with contributions in particular from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Herting (1957</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">1960</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B115">Verbeke (1962a)</xref>. Villeneuve was acknowledged as a significant influence in the regional treatments of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B97">Stein (1924)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Lundbeck (1927)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B120">Wainwright (1928)</xref>. As noted above in a quote from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B120">Wainwright (1928)</xref>, Villeneuve’s personal assistance to contemporary dipterists was as valuable a contribution to science as were his publications.</p>
                <p>Before the Second World War, tachinid specimens from Africa were routinely sent to the Imperial (later Commonwealth) Institute of Entomology in London for identification, but in practise they were identified by Villeneuve in France. This changed when the war severed relations with Villeneuve and the task of identifying <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> fell to the recently hired dipterist, Fritz Isidor van Emden. Thus began van Emden’s foray into the <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> that resulted in his valuable contributions on the faunas of the Afrotropical (as “Ethiopian”) Region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">van Emden 1945</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">1947</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">1960</xref> [the last posthumously]) and British Isles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">van Emden 1954</xref>). In choosing a classification to follow, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">van Emden (1954: 7)</xref> noted:</p>
                <p>“a sound classification has only recently been suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B118">Villeneuve (1924</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B119">1933</xref>) and worked out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Mesnil (1939</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">1944</xref>). Being of such recent date, this ingenious classification has not so far been checked and applied to the whole of the family.”</p>
                <p>Van Emden was slightly too early to take advantage of the progress to come during the 1960s through the efforts of Mesnil, Herting and Verbeke. Van Emden had planned to prepare keys to the whole of the Afrotropical <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> but died before the third part was published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">van Emden 1960</xref>) and before the last and largest part (on <tp:taxon-name>Exoristinae</tp:taxon-name>, as “<tp:taxon-name>Goniinae</tp:taxon-name>”) could be started.</p>
                <p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Dugdale (1969)</xref> was more fortunate in being able to consider the works of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Herting (1957</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">1960</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B115">Verbeke (1962a)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Dupuis (1963)</xref> along with the recently revised classification of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">Mesnil (1966)</xref> in his treatment of New Zealand <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Dupuis (1963)</xref> had concerned himself exclusively with the <tp:taxon-name>Phasiinae</tp:taxon-name> and his classification of the subfamily differed from that of Verbeke’s principally in the exclusion of the <tp:taxon-name>Strongygasterini</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Rondaniooestrini</tp:taxon-name>. Despite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Dugdale’s (1969)</xref> detailed review of recent advances, the New Zealand fauna is a small and isolated one and the affinities of some of its taxa were not resolved by Dugdale and remain uncertain to this day.</p>
                <p>Roger Ward Crosskey became the next dipterist with the Commonwealth Institute of Entomology after the death of van Emden. His would be a remarkable tenure, single-handedly producing a revision of the <tp:taxon-name>Rutiliini</tp:taxon-name> (a tribe of <tp:taxon-name>Dexiinae</tp:taxon-name> confined to the Oriental and Australasian regions, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Crosskey 1973a</xref>), conspecti on the <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> of Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Crosskey 1973b</xref>) and the Oriental Region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Crosskey 1976</xref>), a catalogue of the <!--PageBreak-->Afrotropical<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN13">13</xref> <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Crosskey 1980b</xref>), and keys to the tachinid genera of tropical and southern Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Crosskey 1984</xref>). Additionally, Crosskey later assisted with the preparation of a catalogue of the <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> of the Australasian and Oceanian regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Cantrell and Crosskey 1989</xref>). These resources offered a wealth of information on the names, classification, identification and hosts of Old World non-Palaearctic <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name>. The function of these works, however, was not to investigate and further illuminate the phylogenetic relationships of the <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name>. Perhaps for this reason and for the sake of consistency, the classificatory scheme adopted for the earliest conspectus was carried through with little change to the final catalogue, despite advances in tachinid systematics in the interim.</p>

                <title>The Modern Era</title>
                <p>Nearly 25 years after writing about the biology of the West Palaearctic <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Herting 1960</xref>) and over 75 years after the Palaearctic <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> were last catalogued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Bezzi and Stein 1907</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Herting (1984)</xref> published a long-awaited <italic>Catalogue of Palearctic Tachinidae</italic>. Much had changed since the former catalogue, both in terms of the suprageneric classification and number of genera and species. The tachinid fauna of the Palaearctic Region was the most intensively studied of all regional faunas and an up-to-date catalogue was an invaluable resource. Mesnil’s classification had evolved significantly over the years since publication of <italic>Essai sur les Tachinaires</italic> in 1939 but the changes had taken place in stages and must not have been easy for a non-specialist to follow. Herting had introduced changes too, some accepted by Mesnil and others not. Coincidently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Herting’s (1984)</xref> catalogue came out at the end of Mesnil’s long career and there have not been any sweeping changes to tachinid classification since. What has changed will be discussed further on. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Herting (1984: 2)</xref> compared his classification to that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Herting (1960)</xref>:</p>
                <p>“The subdivision into four subfamilies is the same, only the name <tp:taxon-name>Echinomyiinae</tp:taxon-name> had to be changed into <tp:taxon-name>Tachininae</tp:taxon-name>. Some alterations have been made on the tribal level: The tribe <tp:taxon-name>Goniini</tp:taxon-name> is now restricted to the microoviparous forms, whereas the oviparous and ovolarviparous genera are assembled in a separate tribe, <tp:taxon-name>Eryciini</tp:taxon-name>. In the subfamily <tp:taxon-name>Tachininae</tp:taxon-name>, the number of tribes has been moderately increased, but not all the divisions made by Mesnil (1966b) in Lindner 64g: 885–896, have been accepted. The <tp:taxon-name>Siphonini</tp:taxon-name> are transferred from the <tp:taxon-name>Exoristinae</tp:taxon-name> to the <tp:taxon-name>Tachininae</tp:taxon-name>, where they are certainly better placed.”</p>
                <p>The classification of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Herting (1984)</xref> differed from that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">Mesnil (1966</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">1975a</xref>) primarily in the following respects:</p>
                <p>1) <tp:taxon-name>Winthemiini</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Ethillini</tp:taxon-name> were recognized as tribes of <tp:taxon-name>Exoristinae</tp:taxon-name>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">Mesnil (1975a)</xref> had included them in <tp:taxon-name>Eryciini</tp:taxon-name>, the former as <tp:taxon-name>Winthemiina</tp:taxon-name> and the latter as the three subtribes <tp:taxon-name>Ethillina</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Phorocerosomina</tp:taxon-name>, and <tp:taxon-name>Atylomyina</tp:taxon-name>.</p>
                <!--PageBreak-->
                <p>2) <tp:taxon-name>Dufouriini</tp:taxon-name> were recognized as a tribe of <tp:taxon-name>Dexiinae</tp:taxon-name>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">Mesnil (1966)</xref> had treated <tp:taxon-name>Dufouriina</tp:taxon-name> as a subtribe of <tp:taxon-name>Voriini</tp:taxon-name>.</p>
                <p>3) <tp:taxon-name>Voriini</tp:taxon-name> were recognized, without subtribes, alongside <tp:taxon-name>Dexiini</tp:taxon-name> and <tp:taxon-name>Dufouriini</tp:taxon-name> as one of three Palaearctic tribes in <tp:taxon-name>Dexiinae</tp:taxon-name>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">Mesnil (1966)</xref> had treated his <tp:taxon-name>Voriini</tp:taxon-name> on the same level as the <tp:taxon-name>Voriinae</tp:taxon-name> of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B115">Verbeke (1962a)</xref> with 17 subtribes (see above for the treatment of Mesnil’s <tp:taxon-name>Voriini</tp:taxon-name> in <tp:taxon-name>Tachininae</tp:taxon-name> by Crosskey).</p>
                <p>4) Tribes of <tp:taxon-name>Tachininae</tp:taxon-name> were significantly reduced from the subtribes of <tp:taxon-name>Tachinini</tp:taxon-name> of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">Mesnil (1966)</xref>, although there was a sizable increase over the three tribes formerly recognized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Herting (1960)</xref>. This increase over <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Herting (1960)</xref> was due primarily to a finer splitting of <tp:taxon-name>Echinomyiini</tp:taxon-name> and the separation of <tp:taxon-name>Minthoini</tp:taxon-name> from <tp:taxon-name>Leskiini</tp:taxon-name>.</p>
                <p>Following closely after <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Herting’s (1984)</xref> catalogue was a comprehensive and insightful study of the male postabdomen by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B111">Tschorsnig (1985)</xref>, Herting’s student and later his successor in Stuttgart. Tschorsnig took a comparative approach, describing the structures comprising the male postabdomen, detailing variation throughout the family, and discussing at the end of each taxonomic group the evidence regarding affinities. The work was less focused on the phallus and the pre- and postgonites than that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B115">Verbeke (1962a)</xref> and arrived at some different conclusions. For example, the <tp:taxon-name>Phasiinae</tp:taxon-name> were considered monophyletic based on the structure of the hypandrium rather than on Verbeke’s POS type distiphallus, and the <tp:taxon-name>Dexiinae</tp:taxon-name> of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Herting (1984)</xref> and not <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B115">Verbeke (1962a)</xref> were considered monophyletic based on Verbeke’s type II phallus and type C pregonite. Although Tschorsnig’s study was phylogenetic in nature it did not include a cladogram of inferred relationships. The author may have considered the subject too complex and uncertain to condense into a single cladogram and may have preferred instead to present information about possible relationships in a narrative format.</p>
                <p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Cantrell (1988)</xref> also conducted a comparative study, this one on the postabdomen of both sexes of Australian <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> with descriptions of first instars and puparia. It was based on a thesis that was presumably completed prior to the publication of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B111">Tschorsnig (1985)</xref> because this work was not cited. The study provided a good overview as well as notes about each tribe of Australian <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name>.</p>
                <p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Herting’s (1984)</xref> catalogue has been particularly influential to modern tachinidology because it summarized the current state of knowledge after a long period of change and has been followed subsequently by a period of relative stability. There have been highly significant works on <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> published since 1984 but no revolutionary ideas have emerged about higher level relationships and classification. This is not to say that Herting’s classification is a true reflection of tachinid phylogeny, but rather it has changed little because the large groups that are least likely to be monophyletic (e.g., <tp:taxon-name>Eryciini</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Tachininae</tp:taxon-name>, <tp:taxon-name>Voriini</tp:taxon-name>) have remained too little understood to permit their reclassification along phylogenetic lines.</p>
                <p>Some major regional treatments and larger taxonomic works since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Herting (1984)</xref> are reviewed below. There is still uncertainty about the proper placement of certain <!--PageBreak--><!--PageBreak--><!--PageBreak--><!--PageBreak-->taxa among some of these works and in comparison with the major works during Mesnil’s era. These differences mostly concern smaller taxonomic units, often genera, and rather than discuss them below they are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.</p>

The <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> with 429 entries dwarfs all other dipteran families.</p>
                <p>Traditional taxonomic works of the 21st Century began with a revision of the <tp:taxon-name>Polideini</tp:taxon-name> of America north of Mexico by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">O’Hara (2002)</xref>. There followed a large and well-illustrated work on the identification of <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> of the Russian Far East by <!--PageBreak--><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B83">Richter (2004)</xref>. That same year, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">O’Hara and Wood (2004)</xref> published a catalogue of the <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> of America north of Mexico (discussed above). In this work the previous classification of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B91">Sabrosky and Arnaud (1965)</xref> was revised to conform more closely to the European model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Herting (1984)</xref>. An interactive online resource to the <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> of Europe was produced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B114">Tschorsnig et al. (2004)</xref> as part of the Fauna Europaea project and continues to provide easy access to names and distributions. A catalogue of the <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> of China by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">O’Hara et al. (2009)</xref> provided information on the names, types, distributions, and references of the approximately 1100 species known from this country. The <italic>Manual of Central American Diptera</italic> included a chapter on the <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B124">Wood and Zumbado (2010)</xref> in which 232 genera were reviewed, keyed, and illustrated (mostly with figures from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B123">Wood 1987</xref>), thereby forming a fine companion to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B123">Wood (1987)</xref>. A Ph.D. thesis formed the nucleus of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">Cerretti’s (2010)</xref> two-volume work on the <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> of Italy. This treatise provided a wealth of general information on tachinids in addition to generic descriptions and keys to species of Italian <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name>. Also included was an interactive key to the tachinid genera of the West Palaearctic Region using the program MOSCH, developed primarily by Cerretti. An online MOSCH key to the tachinid genera of the Palaearctic Region was made available recently by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Cerretti et al. (2012a)</xref>.</p>
                <p>The first molecular studies devoted to the <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> made their appearance early in the 21st Century. The <tp:taxon-name>Exoristinae</tp:taxon-name> were the subject of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B98">Stireman’s (2002)</xref> molecular study of genes 28S rRNA and EF-1α. The results were only partly congruent with evidence derived from morphology, most notably in not supporting the monophyly of the <tp:taxon-name>Goniini</tp:taxon-name>. A reappraisal of the same data using a Bayesian analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B99">Stireman 2005</xref>) did not produce a convincing consensus tree, suggesting that the chosen genes may not be good for inferring tribal relationships within <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name>. In a more recent study of the <tp:taxon-name>Exoristinae</tp:taxon-name> by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B101">Tachi and Shima (2010)</xref>, four genes (white, 18S, 28S and 16S rDNA) were studied. The results were similar in most respects to those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B98">Stireman (2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B99">2005</xref>), although monophyly of the <tp:taxon-name>Goniini</tp:taxon-name> was supported. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Kutty et al. (2010)</xref> examined nine gene regions to infer relationships within the <tp:taxon-name>Calyptratae</tp:taxon-name> and especially the <tp:taxon-name>Oestroidea</tp:taxon-name>. In this study their <tp:taxon-name>Tachinidae</tp:taxon-name> were either monophyletic or not, depending upon the type of analysis performed. In general, these early molecular studies have shown promise and more sophisticated approaches in the future using combined morphological and molecular data sets are expected to yield more convincing results.</p>

            <title>Conclusion</title>
            <p>It has been written that to understand the future one must know the past. This is as true of tachinid classification as anything else. The path from Meigen has diverged, joined and meandered to where we are today. Along the way evolutionary thought changed our view of the natural world and the quest to organize animal life then took on new meaning. Chaetotaxy was revealed as an indicator of descent, as were structures <!--PageBreak-->of the male and female genitalia. Homoplasy was and continues to bedevil the proper interpretation of tachinid evolution and is the reason why tachinid classification remains unstable. Nevertheless, a great amount of progress has been made in the last 200 years and new technologies are expected to bring about a better understanding of tachinid phylogeny and with it a more stable and predictive classification.</p>
